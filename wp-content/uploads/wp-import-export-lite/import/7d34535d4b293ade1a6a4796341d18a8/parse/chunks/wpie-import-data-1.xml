<p class="has-medium-font-size">Outsourcing is becoming a standard business model for various size companies, from startups to corporations. No matter how big or small your enterprise is, this highly productive and very profitable practice of relocating some of the business functions and processes to a third-party service provider will ensure a whole set of benefits. </p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="one">Focus on Core Activities (While Outsourcing Other Processes)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The primary benefit of this practice is portrayed in the process of contracting an outside party or business to perform specific procedures and tasks instead of the company. When estimating the need and importance of outsourcing, successful companies realize that it brings significant advantages that affect their performance positively. Below are given the five most important economic benefits of outsourcing that your company may get. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/outsourceing1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1802"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/flat-lay-photography-of-macbook-pro-beside-paper-1509428/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When rapid growth periods occur in a company, business owners and top management may find themselves faced with a lack of employees who will take care of the back office operations. In such a case, companies may have to sacrifice their human and financial resources at the expense of the core activities that brought success to them.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="two"><strong>Increase Efficiency With </strong>Outsourcing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To avoid such sacrifice, you may want to use outsourcing to delegate those activities to an outside company while you focus on the core activities that will result in business improvement and profit.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Goal-oriented companies decide to outsource when they want to increase their business' efficiency. An outside company that has a more significant experience may bring numerous advantages for your business. Therefore, companies who are wondering, "How does outsourcing increase efficiency?" need to get the right partner that has expertise and knowledge of the domain and the outsourcing projects. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1806,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Increase-Efficiency-With-Outsourcing-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1806"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-writing-on-notebook-669615/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, if a mobile app will improve your relationship with customers and grow sales, you don't need to go through the trouble of creating a whole new app development team, but outsource a reliable one that will meet your needs quickly and efficiently. That way, you will increase not only the business' efficiency but also the productivity of your entire company.&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="three">Control Your Costs Through Outsourcing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Outsourcing is also recommended when companies want to save money and control their costs more effectively. Companies who choose to outsource their operations as a way of reducing overall expenses have better chances to release capital for further investments in other areas of their businesses.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1804,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/financial-control-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1804"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-ipad-955447/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your company may more easily take control of its business capital when it has chosen to outsource to different projects. For instance, instead of paying monthly salaries for full-time employees, you may want to decide to outsource a team instead and achieve even better results for less cost. That way, your company will save funds that can later use for developing the business and the company's brand.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="four"><strong>Increase Reach And G</strong>ain Access With Outsourcing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A particularly important benefit of outsourcing for small to midsize businesses is that companies may gain access to capabilities and facilities that they cannot afford otherwise and even increase the company's reach by investing their money in other resources. Plus, they may also refer to outsourcing as a tool for recruiting skilled and educated resources in their respective business areas.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1810,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/recruitment-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1810"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/four-people-holding-green-check-signs-standing-on-the-field-photography-1282270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">That means you and your business are no longer limited to the facilities and employees in your own country. You can outsource and get other companies to find the right workforce and create custom-made teams that transcend the boundaries of the local business ecosystem.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="five"><strong>Get Advantage of the Time Zone Differences </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apart from other benefits that come as a result of choosing to outsource as part of a business strategy, companies may also take advantage of the time zone. In other words, this practice may benefit a company in terms of hiring people from another time zone that will get the work done while the company's office is closed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you want your business to operate round the clock, you should use this advantage and outsource a team that performs while your headquarters is not fully functional.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1808} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/time-zones-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1808"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/london-new-york-tokyo-and-moscow-clocks-48770/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What tasks should you outsource?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Depending on your business needs, there is a broad variety of services you may want to consider outsourcing - from IT services such are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software development (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software development</a>, mobile, and web applications, E-commerce and other IT solutions, to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="digital marketing and sales (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/digital-marketing-and-sales/" target="_blank">digital marketing and sales</a>, and <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/administration-and-virtual-assistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="administration (opens in a new tab)">administration</a> including human resources, accounting, customer related services, and other operations you might need, with no organizational hassle. </p>

Development of technologies and digital marketing innovations are just some of the things that will make a rising trend in the very near future.&nbsp; <br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Online marketing is the marketing of products or services that use digital technologies on the Internet. The digitized marketing has become more and more utilized by businesses ever since people had begun spending their time on the Internet. Digital marketing is an umbrella term for the following online marketing tactics: websites, blogs, eBooks, social media channels, brochures, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Five of the most distinguished marketing trends that are already happening are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="#one">Artificial Intelligence</a></li><li><a href="#two">Chatbots</a></li><li><a href="#three">Voice Interaction</a></li><li><a href="#four">Video and Live Streaming</a></li><li><a href="#five">Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)</a></li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="one"><strong>AI Is t</strong>he Newest Digital Marketing Trend</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the newest digital marketing innovations that will continue to rise in the future and will intend to improve companies’ strategies for creating personalized buyer profiles. AI is supposed to direct its focus on customer segmentation, retargeting, click tracking and push notifications, in order to create profiles for their current and potential customers.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With the help of AI, businesses can implement personalization as the leading marketing online strategy. Instead of focusing on creating experiences for different groups of people, companies that chose to use AI will be able to create unique and personalized experiences for individuals. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[1858],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/art-big-data-blur-373543-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="1858" data-link="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/?attachment_id=1858" class="wp-image-1858"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/abstract-art-blur-bright-373543/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When implementing the AI in a digital marketing strategy, you first need to define your goals and identify the channels you want to use. The AI can be applied as a tool for campaign optimization, product recommendations, as well as for increasing a company’s sales and for improving customer services.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Supported by machine learning algorithms, Artificial Intelligence helps businesses to learn everything about a certain person. That way, companies can personalize their digital marketing strategy and select the experience that most suits a specific person. With the help of AI, businesses are able to tell the computer which types of information to be taken into consideration when determining a person’s digital experience.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although AI has proven to be a very important part of every company’s marketing strategy, many businesses have not been using it very much by now. It is expected that AI will soon be much more implemented as a part of the digital marketing strategies.&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="two"><strong>Chatbots Are</strong> Still Rising In Digital Marketing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Installing a chatbot on a website is one of the digital marketing trends that continue to rise. Although people are still using social media to communicate with brands, websites that have launched chatbots have proven to be more helpful to users.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[1859],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beverage-chat-chatting-1243365-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="1859" data-link="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/?attachment_id=1859" class="wp-image-1859"/><figcaption><br><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/photography-of-person-using-laptop-1243365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source </a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Chatbots are allowing customers to hold a conversation and to get answers to most-asked questions just as they would do from customer support representatives. Moreover, chatbots are a much cheaper alternative to customer service representatives, because customers may use them for getting immediate answers, without wasting their time on waiting.<br></p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="three"><strong>Voice Interaction</strong> Continues To Improve</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another online marketing trend brings increased usage of voice interaction. The technology continues to improve in terms of detecting the fields of natural language processing, as well as in creating conversation interfaces and developing machine learning. That way, virtual assistants are becoming more intelligent and useful to individuals who are using the Internet on a daily basis.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[1860],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cellphone-device-electronics-699122-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="1860" data-link="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/?attachment_id=1860" class="wp-image-1860"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/black-iphone-7-on-brown-table-699122/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The voice search can be conducted either from a computer or from a mobile phone, and it provides you with hundreds of results that match your search. However, when using a virtual assistant such as Apple’s Siri, for instance, the voice search may differ from the text-based search, and you will get a few or only one result. Therefore, websites are encouraged to pay more attention to their SEO strategy for voice search and provide two different meta descriptions when creating their websites.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2 id="four"><strong>Video Is Still B</strong>ooming </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The action of watching videos has turned into a daily activity for every individual that uses a mobile device or computer. Since a video is considered a 20th-century medium, digital video marketing is one of the most utilized strategies and one of the trends that will continue to rise.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Nowadays, individuals prefer to watch videos on their mobile phones or computers, regardless of whether they are using video-sharing websites such as YouTube and <a href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Rumble</a>, or one of the social mediums - Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Video usage is one of the most effective digital marketing tools that marketers use in order to gain impressive amounts of money. As long as the video production and video fundamentals are adequate, companies can utilize the video as a tool for capturing their brand’s personality and conveying much information to their customers.&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apart from video usage, a company’s digital marketing strategy also includes implementation of live video streaming. Businesses are already implementing live streaming as a useful and powerful online marketing tool, regardless of whether it is used for video gameplays and Sony’s PS4 game console, or for influencing the public. The live stream is a direct interaction with social media influencers or traditional sources, and it has proven useful when an influencer responds directly to the customer’s comments.</p>

<h2 id="five"><strong>AR vs. VR In Digital Marketing</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Internet marketing strategy may include both the augmented reality (AR) as well as the virtual reality (VR). In augmented reality, users can experience a real-world environment in which the objects are augmented by computer-generated information, while in virtual reality, the reality is generated through the use of a head-mounted device.&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Businesses are expected to continue using both of those realities, regardless of whether they want to implement VR gaming technology or an AR experience as part of their web marketing strategy. It is only left for us to wait and see which reality will prevail in the future.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the end, you might be wondering which of these digital marketing trends will turn out as a success at the end of this year. What is your opinion? Do you believe that video usage and virtual reality will prevail the habit to read written content or to use chats or not?&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2 id="first">Share Your Blog Posts on Social Media</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Social media strategy involves creating and sharing a wide range of content which is relevant and compelling to your business. One of the most effective pieces of content for an <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/digital-marketing-and-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="online marketing (opens in a new tab)">online marketing</a> strategy is a blog with news and articles that can be shared and promoted on various social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Writing blog articles is an excellent opportunity to mention people, apps, and businesses that are closely connected to your industry, thus expecting from them to do the same thing for you.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Why blog? Having a <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="blog (opens in a new tab)">blog</a> on your website is an excellent way to demonstrate your company’s knowledge of the industry, but it is also a tool for attracting a relevant audience. Before writing blog articles, a company must determine the targeted readers and understand their needs. After determining your reader’s requirements, you can use your blog for social media purposes. That way, you will increase the number of people that will visit your website.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="second">Use Infographics to Attract the Reader’s Attention</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another powerful tip for improving your social media marketing is to utilize well-constructed infographics that will deliver the information to your readers in a concise manner. Infographics are a highly-effective tool when intending to present information and when portraying stories visually.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[2081],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/businessman-charts-close-up-1851448-1024x576.jpg" alt="Infographics and Social Media Marketing" data-id="2081" class="wp-image-2081"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-using-laptop-computer-1851448/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The aim of using infographics is not directed only toward visual representation of an idea, but also toward increasing the company’s sales. Most users love infographics because they can preview the information in a concise and clear format. Companies, on the other hand, like the infographics because they can provide links that will lead readers back to their website, thus gaining more traffic. <br></p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="third">Incorporate Audio in Your Content</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To get full benefits of social media, companies need to pay attention to all methods for delivering a message, such as written content, audio, video, etc. An audio format is a medium that uniquely conveys information, and it gives the user an experience that an image or a text cannot achieve.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[2080],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/broadcasting-electronics-equipment-1212829-1024x576.jpg" alt="Audio Content as Social Media Marketing Tip" data-id="2080" class="wp-image-2080"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/microphone-on-laptop-1212829/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Including audio in a company’s social media marketing strategy is a great idea when marketeers want their company to connect closely to the audience. Some of the audio incorporations on social media are the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Podcasts that cover your business's niche audience</li><li>Audio-tweet on Twitter</li><li>Record clients' interviews and testimonials</li><li>Record interviews and audio messages from the company’s executives and key persons</li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="fourth">Implement Content Calendars for Social Media and Multi-Profile Scheduling</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When creating a social media strategy, it is highly important to use content calendars that will help you organize the content that is supposed to be published on a specific date and at a particular time. Companies need to implement the content calendars for social media in order to get a better preview of the work ahead and to know when to schedule a specific post.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[2078],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blurred-background-calendar-cellphone-18934241-1024x576.jpg" alt="Calendar as part of the Social Media Marketing strategy" data-id="2078" class="wp-image-2078"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/macbook-pro-turned-on-displaying-schedule-on-table-1893424/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Part of the preparations for an excellent strategy for social media marketing is to save time on posting the same post on different social media platforms. For that reason, companies are encouraged to use programs or apps that provide them with the option of multi-profile scheduling. Those programs on the internet may be used for scheduling posts at the same time on multiple numbers of social media profiles. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are also tools that help companies schedule posts for an entire month ahead by only dedicating a few hours at the beginning of each month. However, that does not mean you shouldn't carefully keep track of what is going on your social media channels. On the contrary - online communication between your company and your customers requires attention and care, thus appointing a dedicated person to monitor and manage your social media is crucial.&nbsp;</p>

<h5 id="mce_19">by <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/author/ana-cakic/">Ana Ćakić</a></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With over eight years of experience as a <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software engineer (opens in a new tab)">software engineer</a> and senior PHP developer, Zharko Mircheski is not only one of the best programmers in Cosmic Development, but he has been a real family member ever since he joined the company in 2013. Back then, Cosmic Development was a company of approximately 30 employees, and Zharko was perceived as a valuable team player right from the start.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a senior PHP developer, Zharko is primarily responsible for code writing and code reviewing, but his scope of work also includes participating in R&amp;D meetings where the implementation of new technologies is discussed, mentoring new associates, helping other colleagues with resolving code implementation issues, etc. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">His contribution to projects like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="md.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.md.com/" target="_blank">MD.com</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bookmark.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bookmark.com/" target="_blank">Bookmark.com</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="rumble.com, (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank">Rumble.com,</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="somespider.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://somespider.com/" target="_blank">SomeSpider.com</a> is enormous and most appreciated. That's one of the main reasons why Zharko was given a recognition award in 2018 for 5 years of outstanding work at our company. <br></p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What was the biggest challenge when you started working in Cosmic Development?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Remembering the names of all new colleagues, but I guess that's probably the initial challenge everyone gets faced with when starting a new position in an unfamiliar working environment. On a more serious note, I'd say that the biggest challenge was adopting the company culture and procedures. The social aspect is as important as the technical part of a new job. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>If you were to offer a piece of advice (as a senior PHP developer) to your less-experienced colleagues, what would it be? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">What I think is crucial when starting at a new company regardless of a professional level or industry is to pay attention, ask the right questions to the right people, be proactive and assure other colleagues that they can count on you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Being a part of a highly productive team is both rewarding and demanding. How do you overcome stressful situations?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It does feel rewarding to be part of so many projects. However, it's also challenging and sometimes even stressful, especially when you're aware that some of these projects are actually the backbone of multi-million businesses. What I have learned over the years is that you should always strive to focus on the problem itself and don't let the thinking of "what ifs" distract you. Every now and then, a situation occurs when I feel like I have tried every possible solution to locate and/or fix a problem but still failed to find the right one. I am sure a lot of you have had the same feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What do you do then?﻿</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When something like that happens, I usually take a short coffee break, go play a game of ping pong with some of my colleagues, or simply go out to get some fresh air. The routine break can do wonders for overcoming obstacles. A good alternative is to ask your colleagues to help you out. The second pair of eyes can spot the "stupid" mistake you can't see. ;)<br></p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What's your favorite "know-how" source?﻿﻿</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are many of them, but I'll start with books. Nowadays, it is very easy to go online and find what you need to fix a problem, but it is necessary to have a solid base of programming knowledge and skills if you want to be a good programmer.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are many excellent books on programming and software, but my favorite ones are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Clean Code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank"><em>Clean Code</em></a> by Robert C Martin and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612" target="_blank"><em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em></a> by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm. The first one offers insights for best practices on writing clean, understandable and testable code, while the second one is essential for understanding how the code is structured in object-oriented constructs, how to use them and how to recognize which design pattern to choose for solving a particular problem.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The other aspect is to get familiar with the stack you work on by using the documentation websites of a specific language, but sometimes even "lighter reads" can help catch up with new tech.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[1924],"align":"center"} -->

<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What would be the top 5 (or more) websites for PHP developers of your choice?﻿</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">An excellent place to find almost everything when it comes to PHP is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="php.net (opens in a new tab)" href="https://php.net/" target="_blank">php.net</a>. Depending on the framework, PHP developers also use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="laravel.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel.com</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="symfony.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony.com</a>, or in case of WordPress <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="wordpress.org (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress.org</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In terms of services, pages like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="developers.facebook.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/" target="_blank">developers.facebook.com</a> (for Facebook APIs) and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="developers.google.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developers.google.com/docs/api/" target="_blank">developers.google.com</a> (for Google APIs)&nbsp; can also be very helpful. If you need to add online payment, you would want to check <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="developer.paypal.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developer.paypal.com/" target="_blank">developer.paypal.com</a> or <a href="https://stripe.com/docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="stripe.com (opens in a new tab)">stripe.com</a>, and for email campaigns, the place to go to is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="developer.mailchimp.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developer.mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">developer.mailchimp.com</a>. It all depends on the stack and services you use.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When you get stuck with something (a senior PHP developer does it too) - just google it, and most of the time <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="stackoverflow.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com</a> will provide you with the solution. However, please bear in mind to avoid the copy/paste option. :)<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I can also recommend <a href="https://dev.to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dev.to (opens in a new tab)">dev.to</a> because there's always something new and exciting to read on that web site. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What is your greatest professional accomplishment so far? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don't think I can point to one specific thing as I've worked on many different projects and gathered valuable experience from all of them. But I can say that I'm really proud of my work for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="rumble.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank">Rumble.com</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bookmark.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bookmark.com/" target="_blank">Bookmark.com</a>.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I guess the most significant accomplishment is that I have grown as a developer and as a professional, and this is an ongoing process.</p>

<h4>﻿Can you give our readers advice on how to be more productive at work? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">That depends on the working environment as much as on a developer him/herself. I found that I am most productive when I know precisely what I need to work on. So I guess it's a good idea to define your tasks first and then try to clear the list in the timeframe you have set as your target. Preferably before the deadline. :)</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Well, I like ping pong a lot. We play it at work almost every day. We have teams and keep scores of our matches, and from time to time, we even make tournaments.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I also like to go out with my friends, watch good movies, and read books. I love to play games on my PC, but lately, I don't have much time for that. The best fun I have these days is when I'm playing with my little daughter.<br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The battle of machines vs. humans is a topic that is present in every aspect of our lives. As technology improves, machines and robots are becoming smarter and smarter, and more used on a day-to-day basis. What we thought might happen in the future is actually happening right now, and it is developing at a super-fast pace. According to experts, artificial intelligence (AI) is the next big thing that will improve people's lives. But will it? If yes, what will happen to our own, human intelligence?<br></p>

<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In order to understand the very term Artificial Intelligence, we tried to find the best definition. However, there is not an officially accepted definition that explains its purpose. The phrase artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machine learning and to the procedure that enables computers to discover real-life patterns and to imitate the function of the human brain.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The AI may be interpreted as a machine learning system that has become smart with hard training. The most appropriate artificial intelligence examples are:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Strategic games, such as chess, tic tac toe, where the machine makes decisions found on possible steps that are based on inquiring knowledge.</li><li>Communication with computers, where the machine understands the human language.</li><li>Expert systems and applications giving clarification to the users, where machines are incorporated with programming and other data.</li><li>Vision systems, such as spying planes or drones, where the machine understands and interprets the visual input.</li><li>Speech recognition systems, where the machine understands the human language (slang, accent, noise).</li><li>Handwriting recognition systems, where the machine reads a written text and converts different letter shapes into an editable text.&nbsp;</li><li>Intelligent robots that have various sensors detecting physical data that only a human being may experience.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[2208],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pexels-photo-2599244-1024x682.jpeg" alt="" data-id="2208" class="wp-image-2208"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/high-angle-photo-of-robot-2599244/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Note that this definition changes with time just like the artificial intelligence evolves and what today is known as AI may not be the same in 10-years time, for instance. There are many differences between artificial intelligence and the human brain, which will be discussed below.<br></p>

<h2>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to experts, the artificial intelligence will undoubtedly improve people's lives in the future. However, some of those experts are also concerned that the rapid development of AI might affect the productivity of human intelligence and the people's expression of their free personal choices.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Speed of execution</li><li>Less biased</li><li>Ability to operate without a pause</li><li>Accuracy and preciseness</li><li>Dominance in certain areas</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, some issues still point out human intelligence over the AI. Five most important aspects in which the machine differs from the human being are:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Energy efficiency - AI uses less energy than people's brain;</li><li>Universal - AI is designed only for a few tasks, while people learn different skills throughout their entire lifespan;</li><li>Multitasking - people are able to multitask, but machines need more time to learn every responsibility;</li><li>Decision making - people learn how to make decisions in life, while machines can hardly compete with a six-year-old child;</li><li>Analog vs. digital - people's brains are analog, machines are digital.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to this analysis, we can see that although people work hard on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI), the human brain is still superior in many aspects.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">People use a combination of several cognitive processes, while machines are programmed to imitate human behavior. While the AI has a significant advantage over human intelligence, some experts believe that computers will never be fully able to replace people and the irreplaceable human resource.&nbsp;<br></p>

It is left to the future to show us whether "machines vs. humans" is the battle that will mark this century. <br></p>

    <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[The battle of machines vs. humans is a topic that is present in every aspect of our lives. As technology improves, machines and robots are becoming smarter and smarter, and more used on a day-to-day basis. What we thought might happen in the future is actually happening right now, and it is developing at a super-fast pace. According to experts, artificial intelligence (AI) is the next big thing that will improve people's lives. But will it? If yes, what will happen to our own, human intelligence?]]></excerpt:encoded>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Not everyone is lucky enough to have a job they genuinely feel passionate about, but Mile Milosheski doesn't belong to that group of less fortunate individuals. He is a WordPress expert<strong> </strong>one of the most enthusiastic developers Cosmic Development ever had. We feel honored for the opportunity to share a piece of his story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Mile's journey through the world of <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software development (opens in a new tab)">software development</a> started almost a decade ago while he was still a student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje, Macedonia. Thanks to his insatiable<strong> </strong>hunger for knowledge, his incredible talent and profound understanding of software development, Mile soon became an active member of Macedonian WordPress Community and one of the volunteers at CodeCamp MK, the most significant event in Macedonia for IT professionals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Nowadays, he is considered to be not only a WordPress expert but a real WordPress whisperer among not only our own developers but the wider WordPress community in the country. He is specialized in the development and design of user-friendly custom made WordPress and WooCommerce applications and custom made plugins from scratch and generally working as a full-stack LAMP developer.<br></p>

<h4><strong>Your Cosmic journey (as we love to call it) started over three years ago. How would you describe it so far?</strong><br></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are too few words to describe that, so I'll just point out the most important reasons why I've decided to join and stay with Cosmic Development. I can say without any doubt in my mind that the crucial reason was (and still is) the people of Cosmic. The guys here are simply amazing! I also appreciate the flexibility of the working hours and the variety of projects that allows me to try out new things and always keep me up to date with new technologies and trends. Not to forget the compensation :), regular promotions and raises. It all gives me the feeling that there is someone here who acknowledges the efforts and rewards our commitment and hard work.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>What was the biggest challenge when you started working in Cosmic?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The biggest challenge since I’ve joined the company was the beginning of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.littlethings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">LittleThings.com</a> project, which is now one of the most popular collections of uplifting stories, videos, and exciting DIY projects, with approximately 2 million daily visitors on the website, and #1 FB content provider. The responsibility was enormous, but so was the excitement! Vlad (Vladimir Novachki), our CTO has recognized my enthusiasm, and immediately assigned me as one of the core developers of the project. The experience I gained during that time was priceless. It practically led to where I am now and prepared me for new projects like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scarymommy.com/" target="_blank">Scarymommy.com</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thedad.com/" target="_blank">Thedad.com</a>, and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cafe.com/" target="_blank">Cafe.com</a>, for example.<br></p>

<h4><strong>How stressful is your job and how do you overcome nerve-racking situations in general?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It might sound crazy, but in stressful situations, I drink espresso. Yeah, that’s true! Each time I find myself stressed, workwise or else, I go to a coffee shop on the ground floor of the business center where our office is located, and I have my kryptonite (a.k.a. double espresso shot) alone. Then I brainstorm by myself and rise to the occasion instantly! :)</p>

<h4><strong>What do you see as your most significant professional accomplishment so far? </strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think that the greatest achievements are yet to come! I’m young, and the development of my career is an ongoing process. I can say with confidence that the solid basis has been laid, but there are still many miles to go. So the answer to this question is - I’m working on it :)</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>Where do you find inspiration for your work? </strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many different places where one can look for inspiration regardless of what one does. Sometimes that can be a more experienced colleague or some other role model figure, or something wholly insubstantial like a thought or a feeling. However, my inspiration always comes from my family, and the need to put food on the table. Their well being means the world to me, and nothing seems like hard work when I think of them. Deep house music helps too!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Well, there are six actually:</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Hacker News (THN) is another great website where I get the news from the industry, as it proves to be one of the leading and trustworthy cybersecurity news platforms, followed by millions of IT professionals. The Delicious Brains' blog also offers tons of useful advice and how-to hacks I like to check out on a regular basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first three platforms are listed here for the obvious reason - they are THE places to go whenever web developers have any issues or questions. I also like to use Reddit and check out what a community there has to say about certain matters.</p>

<h4><strong>How do you like to start your day? Do you have a particular morning ritual at the office? </strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My morning ritual doesn't start at the office. It actually starts at the same coffee shop I mentioned earlier. That's my first stop on the way to work where I take my double espresso coffee and get the day started. Then I head straight to my desk and check my inbox, reply to emails, and organize my daily tasks, coordinate with my <a href="https://somespider.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Some Spider</a> team members on Slack and get my hands dirty with PHP :D</p>

<h4><strong>Where do you find the strength to keep going when the road gets bumpy? Who are your heroes? Who inspires you? </strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This one is easy to answers :) MY FAMILY - they’re my heroes! They’re always there for me. They give me both the structure and the meaning; they never fail to support me and give me the right direction. I feel I owe my success to them. <br></p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are probably many achievements that I could list here, from the professional ones to those that only resonate on a very personal level, but again - none of that would happen, or better said, truly matter if it wasn't for my family. My beloved wife and my amazing son are the most important realization of my life. I'm a proud husband and a dedicated father of a two-year-old boy :) - that's who I am. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">For fun, huh? I enjoy drinking quality scotch! I also love hanging out with my family and friends. When time is not an issue (which is way less often than I would want it to be), I enjoy going to a movie theater. When the weather is beautiful, I like going cycling by myself or just take my family for a nice walk in the city’s park to get some fresh air and enjoy our time together. <br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Have you ever thought about IT outsourcing or relocating some other <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="business processes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/administration-and-virtual-assistance/" target="_blank">business processes</a> into a foreign country? Well, if you haven't - now is the time! Even though it seems that we are still relatively far from setting up the real galactic enterprises (our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Cosmic crew (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Cosmic crew</a> can hardly wait for that to happen), humankind did manage to make the 21st-century world interconnected better than ever before. The new technologies made it all unbelievably accessible and efficient, and that means doing business on a global level has never been easier. The companies are no longer limited to local markets nor local resources, so why not use those new circumstances? <br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Practically, no matter what type of business you are dealing with, you can set it up wherever you seem fit - from your own neighborhood to the most distant place you can imagine. Cosmic Development as a Canadian IT support services company has chosen Serbia and Macedonia to set up its operational centers, and here are the top 5 reasons why. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Beside strictly business-related reasons why Serbia and Macedonia remain our first choice for relocating our operational centers there, there are other exciting details about these two countries and their people.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For instance, did you know that seven Serbian-American scientists and engineers have participated in the construction of Apollo spaceships and helped to put a man on the Moon? Moreover, the well-known message "Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here," spoken by Jack Swigert to the NASA Mission Control Center during the Apollo 13 spaceflight, was in fact received by one of those seven Serbs, now retired NASA engineer David Vuich. Furthermore, brilliant minds and world-famous scientists and inventors such as Nikola Tesla, Mihajlo Pupin, and Milutin Milanković, were also Serbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">A pioneer of performance art and one of the most influential figures of contemporary art, Marina Abramović, was born and raised in Belgrade, Serbia. She has been using her own body as both art subject and object since the early 1970s but truly gained worldwide fame in the 2000s, especially after her now-legendary retrospective exhibition/performance in The Museum of Modern Art, titled The Artist Is Present. Right next to Marina, stand the pleiad of giants like Emir Kusturica, movie director and two times winner of Palme d'Or at Cannes, Volter Bogdanić, a three-time Pulitzer prize winner, Karl Malden, the first Serbian Oscar winner, Vlade Divac, one of the first Europeans to play a vital role in the NBA and, of course, Novak Djoković, the world's best tennis player.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Plus, officially the Best Major European Festival, and one of the world's leading music festivals in general, takes place in Serbia! Every summer the Exit Festival gathers hundreds of thousands of young people from all over the world at the Petrovaradin Fortress in Novi Sad, Serbia, for almost two decades. During all these years almost nearly every major music artist has performed there, but the biggest celebration is yet to come next year when EXIT 2.0 will mark 20th anniversary of the world-renowned Serbian festival.<br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the other hand, Macedonia offers breathtaking landscapes and restful place just outside their capital city. Besides the beautiful Vodno mountain that rises right next to Skopje and serves as a daily haven from the hustle and bustle of the city, less than 12 miles from Skopje lies a canyon called Matka with Vrelo, one of the deepest underwater caves in the world. The assumed depth of the cave is more than 1,650 feet (500 meters), but only 787.4 feet (240 meters) of it has been explored so far. One more exciting spot in the northern part of Macedonia is called Kokino. It's considered to be the fourth oldest astronomic observatory in the world, along with Abu Simbel in Egypt, the famous Stonehenge in Great Britain, and spectacular Angkor Wat in Cambodia. This Macedonian Bronze Age archaeological site is situated less than 20 miles (about 30 km) from the town of Kumanovo.<br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another natural beauty in Macedonia is the town Ohrid, which lies in the south-western part of the country. Ohrid is one of the oldest settlements in Europe, and it bears the nickname "Jerusalem of the Balkans" due to the disposal of a large number of churches and monasteries in such small territory. Moreover, Ohrid lies on a beautiful lake, which is three million years old and is one of the oldest and deepest lakes in Europe. The beauty of the town combined with the lake that mirrors the buildings proclaimed Ohrid as one of the <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="UNESCO World Heritage (opens in a new tab)">UNESCO World Heritage</a> sites.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">All these and many other astonishing Macedonian sites, as well as the city of Skopje, deserve more considerable international attention. So, it wouldn't hurt to remind that Mother Theresa of Calcutta, the world celebrated humanitarian and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was actually born in the capital of Macedonia. The Memorial House of Mother Teresa is one of the most visited sites in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Business scaling is a step that companies take when they want to grow their business to the next level. Companies can scale their businesses as soon as they feel ready for the process of growth. At first, companies that prepare for scaling of their business must develop an idea. After that, they need to build a team that will help in the realization of that idea. Next, they will create a product that is fit for the market and sell the idea to potential customers. In other words, the only thing that companies need to focus on is how to scale a business fast and expand it easily. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Scaling a company" means "to grow or expand" a business "in a proportional and usually profitable way," as defined in Merriam Webster. A business scaling is possible when the company can cope with an increased amount of work while at the same time can maintain or increase its efficiency. Therefore, entrepreneurs may help their businesses scale by increasing both their workload and their efficiency at the same time. <br></p>

Knowing how to face such hold-ups will help you with the business scaling procedure.Image source ","jsonImageSrc":"https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/adults-analysis-banking-1451447.jpg"},{"id":"how-to-step-1566209751345","name":[{"type":"strong","props":{"children":["Find the Most Qualified Staff or Choose to Outsource"]}}," "],"text":["",{"type":"br","props":{"children":[]}},"The final practice of scaling a business requires companies to hire the most qualified people internally or from a remote location.

Most struggling entrepreneurs fail in this area because they're focused on the wrong things. Companies need to look beyond daily tasks and projects on their to-do lists. Instead, they should evaluate their next move, evolve and take it to the next level.<br/>Companies must analyze whether their businesses are ready for growth. If they focus on the essential details, they will know the current and the desired position of their business on the market. However, companies will definitely stagnate if they fail to focus on critical activities that will help their businesses move forward strategically.<br/>To scale a business, companies must determine what they need to increase their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/digital-marketing-and-sales/" target="_blank">sales</a>. They need to think of which technologies and systems they will use, or how many people to employ. <br/><br/><img alt="focus on business scaling" src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/adult-analysis-chart-1516704.jpg"/><br/><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-a-laptop-on-top-of-table-1516704/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a> <br/></p> </li><li class="schema-how-to-step" id="how-to-step-1566209179665"><strong class="schema-how-to-step-name"><strong>Identify the Core Strengths of the Business</strong> </strong> <p class="schema-how-to-step-text"><br/>Another step of the business scaling strategy is to discover what a company does best in its niche and what sets it apart from the competition. Entrepreneurs need to identify the core strengths of their business to compete for clients effectively. <br/>Moreover, companies must analyze the business environment and compare their business scaling strategy with the ones of their competitors. They need to create the most appropriate strategy for placing their company at the top, among other similar companies. <br/>Therefore, a business must first identify what is best done within the company and how the competition may be surpassed. This is usually done by creating a SWOT analysis of the company’s Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Once companies complete their specific SWOT analysis, they will be able to identify the core strengths of their business.<br/><br/><img alt="SWOT analysis for scaling a business" src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/analysis-coffee-copy-space-1488034.jpg"/><br/><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-using-macbook-pro-while-holding-ceramic-mug-on-gray-wood-surface-1488034/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a> <br/></p> </li><li class="schema-how-to-step" id="how-to-step-1566209254753"><strong class="schema-how-to-step-name"><strong>Develop a Network of Connections and Focus on Using Various Marketing Channels</strong> </strong> <p class="schema-how-to-step-text"><br/>Developing a network of connections and key relationships is crucial when the company is prepared to scale a business and focus on long-term growth. Business scaling is achievable through both building new connections and fostering the already existing ones. Business owners need to also build stronger relationships with their employees and make new connections with other companies as well. <br/>Companies need to focus more on marketing and indirect channels. Having a good <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-tips-for-improving-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank">social media marketing</a> strategy is the key to success for building a network of connections online, especially through social media such as: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cosmic-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">LinkedIn</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/cosmicdevelop" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.facebook.com/cosmicdevelopment/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/cosmicdevelopment/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.<br/>When scaling a business model, entrepreneurs should learn how to generate more leads by discovering what their competitors are advertising on television or online.  <br/><br/><img alt="Connections for business scaling" src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/business-deal-collaboration-colleagues-1483933.jpg"/><br/><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/agreement-arms-business-business-agreement-1483933/" target="_blank">Image source</a> <br/></p> </li><li class="schema-how-to-step" id="how-to-step-1566209580972"><strong class="schema-how-to-step-name"><strong>Gather Money and Secure the Sales</strong> </strong> <p class="schema-how-to-step-text"> <br/>When scaling a business, companies are faced with a lot of expenses. One of the most common costs happens when the business scaling strategy requires the hiring of new employees. Increasing the staff implies new expenses and new salaries that the company must pay to realize the scaling procedure. <br/>To gather money, companies need to use certain techniques such as bootstrapping - starting up an enterprise with minimal financial resources. However, this technique is not enough because it takes a lot of time until it gets the wanted results. There are small business contests that grant cash prizes to companies who choose to participate in the contest. Another way to gather money for the business scaling strategy is through getting loans or credits from banks or other financial institutions. Gathering the needed money will help companies secure their sales and achieve their business’ growth.<br/><br/><img alt="Money for business scaling" src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bank-notes-cash-dollars-163056.jpg"/><br/><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/1-us-dollar-bill-163056/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a> <br/></p> </li><li class="schema-how-to-step" id="how-to-step-1566209622105"><strong class="schema-how-to-step-name"><strong>Invest in IT Support Systems and Technology</strong> </strong> <p class="schema-how-to-step-text"><br/>When scaling a business, entrepreneurs need to find a way to automate the process. Investing in technology makes the business scaling strategy easier. A wise investment in IT support systems may result in fewer expenses. Automation of the scaling procedure and investing in a dozen of IT support systems may minimize the manual work, thus lowering the costs of running the company. Alongside the growth of a company, the IT support systems must also grow, so that potential communication and management problems are avoided.<br/>Companies can save resources and time by evaluating their new products on the market by using marketing automation, sales management, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/administration-and-virtual-assistance/" target="_blank">human resources (HR), accounting</a>, and other technology systems. They can also set up cloud storage, organize training procedures for new hires, invest in payroll for rapid processing, etc. Companies are recommended to begin early with this practice to see their businesses scale faster.  <br/><br/><img alt="IT systems" src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/connection-control-center-desk-256219.jpg"/><br/><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/men-working-at-night-256219/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a> <br/></p> </li><li class="schema-how-to-step" id="how-to-step-1566209710816"><strong class="schema-how-to-step-name"><strong>Deal with Hold-Ups</strong> </strong> <p class="schema-how-to-step-text"><br/>As the company grows while scaling a business, entrepreneurs may face a time when things will not be running smoothly or when they may be delayed. In such a situation, companies will have to come up with back-up solutions to support growth and keep operations running well.<br/>The hold-ups may show up in different ways. A hold-up may occur when there is only one person available to complete a task, when tasks are inaccurately delegated to team members, or when team members cannot operate without talking to the business owner. Moreover, hold-ups can happen when failing to bill enough for active work, failing to offer leveraged and passive contributions that do not require much time, lacking systems and process management, and having the need to check and double-check every task.

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Intellectual property protection (copyright, trademark or patent) is not reserved just for inventions and other physical contraptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In fact, there exists such a wide array of possible spheres of protection that the United States government had to establish an entire bureaucratic department in order to oversee the implementation of such policies: the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">By registering your app with the USPTO, you can protect your ideas from thieves and insulate your inventions from the competition of other like-minded developers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Of course, the benefits of registering your copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets don’t just exist in a vacuum. Bureaucracy has never been known to be as navigable as your ingenious GUIs, but that’s where your lawyer comes in. Let them worry about the hassle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Once you’ve secured your lawyer and a sound understanding of the copyright system, you’re ready to begin the process. Still don’t understand? Let me break it down for you!</p>

<h2><strong>Why You Need to Copyright Your App</strong><br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">First and foremost, what is copyright? A copyright is a formal declaration of ownership of written works, whether published or unpublished. When you really break it down, official, registered copyrights function as your very own sort of government-backed quasi-monopolies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">How does this apply to an app? Simple: apps are written in code and contain written words throughout the entire body of code. All of this qualifies as written work under the regulations surrounding copyright and intellectual property law.</p>

<h3><strong>Costs of Not Procuring a Copyright</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Copyrights enable you to sue somebody for infringing on your ideas. If you have a copyright that has been officially registered with the US government, then your ideas are safe and sound; however, if not, then you have very little supporting evidence allowing you to sue.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">This can result in anywhere from a few thousand dollars in attorney’s fees and court costs to the entire loss of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that you would have been able to earn had your idea not been stolen by somebody who can offer it cheaper without your consent.<br></p>

<h3><strong>Benefits of Copyrighting</strong><br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Patents and copyrights designed for apps provide a few of the same benefits as patents and copyrights in general but also a few unique benefits specific to applications and other forms of <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/">software development</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The general benefits are that you and only you can legally use the app for commercial purposes, meaning that nobody else can take your code or your software and sell it on their own, even if they can do it better, more efficiently, or at a lower cost than you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Combine that with the specific benefits of preventing your software and its hundreds of lines of code from being tampered with by thieves and you become capable of enjoying artificially high prices that enable you to rake in much higher profits than if your app were available for idea-vultures to pick at on the free market.</p>

<h2><strong>Secure a Lawyer</strong><br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">So what’s the first step in protecting apps with IP law? Unless you want to suffer thousands of dollars in fees and countless hours in lost time while splitting your attention between developing your app and filling out paperwork, you need to get a lawyer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to J.D. Houvener, a New York patent attorney, “Patent attorneys are willing to take on the bulk of your workload during the process for a small fee that oftentimes comes out to less than you would otherwise have to pay the USPTO.”</p>

<h3>Spend More Time on Your Code<br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Once you’ve filled your attorney in on everything that you plan to do with your app and provided them with the necessary documentation, you can typically wash your hands of the process. Of course, it’s always good to remain open to help your attorney when possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This means less time spent sifting through databases, formulating legal arguments, and trying to get through to the bureaucrats on the other end of the phone in the US government.</p>

<h3>Attorneys Provide Peace of Mind<br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">People make mistakes. Attorneys don’t.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At least, that’s what they’ll tell you. It’s typically said as a joke, of course, but there’s quite a bit of truth to this. It’s been said that “a person who represents himself has a fool for a client.” The reason for this is that attorneys tend to know much more about the legal system than the average person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. If you had chest pain, would you treat it yourself or would you see a doctor? If you needed somebody to increase your app’s number of downloads, would you do it yourself or would you hire a marketing firm?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The same logic applies to hiring an attorney. Much like you would consider outsourcing for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/administration-and-virtual-assistance/" target="_blank">administrative assistance</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/digital-marketing-and-sales/" target="_blank">digital marketing</a>, you should also consider outside help for an area as nuanced as IP law.</p>

<h2>How It’s Done<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are a few notable requirements that you need to pay attention to before attempting to patent or copyright your app:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The app must be original.</li><li>The app must be non-obvious (meaning not the obvious next step in the development of another app).</li><li>The app must have noticeable utility.</li><li>The app must not have been disclosed prior to the beginning of the application.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are a few other requirements at various other levels in the process, but you can leave those to your patent attorney. They’d be too voluminous to discuss here anyway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Once you’ve satisfied these requirements and confirmed with your attorney, the next step in how to patent an idea is to start the application process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The application process can take any number of months, typically winding down at about 22 months for standard patents, although copyrights can typically be done less than a quarter of that time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>In Conclusion<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you’ve made this far, give yourself a quick pat on the back. The most difficult step in the development of an app is, well, the actual development of the app. So stop stressing about patents, copyrights, trademarks, and all of the legal jargon associated with those.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Leave the stress to your attorney. That way, when you begin the application process, you can say goodbye to the paperwork and the stress of wondering if you’re doing it right instead of saying goodbye to your free time and your work-life balance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Once you’ve done all of this, you’ll be one step closer to making the next big app!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Not all working days are the same for software developers. However, developers spend most of their time seated in front of a computer, coding all day (and night) and trying to meet predetermined deadlines. In almost all situations, <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="web developers (opens in a new tab)">web developers</a> seem to behave as machines who only care about the task they need to complete for the day, and many of them believe that they can function solely on coffee. Thus, they do not pay enough attention to their health and are leading an unhealthy lifestyle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Developers are highly encouraged to use regular breaks in their working days in order to endure the difficulty of their daily tasks. Taking breaks for different reasons have proven to be beneficial to the work efficiency of programmers. Continue reading the sections below to find out 7 most useful ways that website developers could use to break their daily work routines:</p>

<h2 id="Pauses">Take Regular Pauses in Between Tasks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Programming is not an easy job, mainly because software developers are often faced with long hours of sitting in front of their computers and coding. This may prove to be unhealthy for them. Therefore, they need to take regular pauses in between tasks. The main routine breaker for software developers is to organize their tasks in a specific order and take consistent pauses after a predetermined period of time. They can use their breaks as a way to distract themselves from work and to clear their minds through activities that may improve the quality of their work. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Regardless of the activity that programmers choose, they will notice how taking a break in their daily routine can help them think better about the task at hand and help them figure out how to complete the work for that day in the most efficient way possible.</p>

<h2 id="Pomodoro">Use the Pomodoro Technique (Tomato Timer)<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software developers are encouraged to use the Pomodoro Technique as one of their routine breakers. Pomodoro means "tomato" in Italian, and the technique is named after the tomato timer that had been primarily used as a cooking tool. Nowadays, the Pomodoro technique is a useful time management method that helps developers break down their work into equal intervals. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In general, each interval, also known as Pomodoro, lasts 25 minutes and is followed by a short break of three to five minutes. This technique is nowadays becoming more and more popular among programmers as a routine breaker, especially after the creation of applications and websites such as&nbsp;Tomato Timer&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pomodoro Timer &amp; To-Do List.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Food">Make Pauses for Food and Beverages</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Programmers are frequently overwhelmed with work and forget that they need to try and keep a healthy lifestyle, despite the workload they have in front of them. Therefore, they need to keep in mind that they must make short breaks for food and beverages between different tasks. A good routine breaker for software developers is to make pauses to drink water or eat lunch/dinner after each task, for instance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, programmers often drink beverages or eat their food while sitting in front of computers and even while working. This is wrong. If they really want to get benefit from the break, they are highly encouraged to change their room or office and go someplace else to eat or drink. That way, web developers will be able to clear their minds and to freshen up before they get back to work. </p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Fresh-Air">Go out for Fresh Air and Natural Light<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sitting in front of a computer for many hours may cause software developers to feel sleepy or even nauseous. Moreover, staring at a computer screen all day long may also cause fatigue, headaches, and migraines. Therefore, one of the routine breakers that programmers need to use more often during their working hours is to take pauses for fresh air and natural light. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Inhaling fresh air increases the oxygen level in the lungs, thus increases the clarity of the brain and helps developers focus better on work assignments. Furthermore, natural daylight reminds the body that it should still stay active because outside of the office is still daytime. Therefore, web developers and other employees who spend their days in a closed and dark office need to breathe fresh air and expose themselves to natural light at least once per hour.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Music">Listen to Music</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although some people believe that music can be a distraction, it is a good routine breaker, especially in stressful situations. Software developers are encouraged to listen to energetic music in order to stay focused on their work, but also to keep a higher level of happiness. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Music stimulates neurotransmitters in the brain, and it helps in minimizing the distractions that may come from the office or other co-workers. Nowadays, there are tons of music compilations for concentration, inspiration, focus, etc. Web developers are encouraged to listen to steady or upbeat music without lyrics that will help them stay focused on their complicated work assignments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Gaming">Play Games</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Playing games is an excellent way to break a daily work routine, especially when dealing with loads of work and stressful situations. Gaming relaxes the software developers' brains after a hard day's work and helps them get distracted from problems and stress. However, although it may seem like a good work routine breaker, programmers are not fully advised to spend their breaks just on gaming, because they usually play games on their phones, tablets, and even the same computers that they work on. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To utilize the real effect of gaming during a work break, web developers are encouraged to get a bigger projector screen that will be at least 10 meters further than them. Otherwise, using electronic devices may only cause sleep deprivation and will not help in getting refreshed during a break from work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Note: </strong>Playing board games may be an even better alternative than playing phone games and staring at a phone screen on your work break. You can bring your favorite board games from home, or you can purchase one for the office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Sports">Intensify Sports Activities and Exercises<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another way of breaking a daily working routine of a software developer is to exercise and play sports activities in the office. It’s a fact that regular exercise and sports activities boost the employee’s concentration. Some companies offer gym discounts to their employees as a way to help them stay fit and healthy despite their workload. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, when a company has a low budget for such discounts, web developers may use their creativity and choose between the following sports activities for the office:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Table Tennis (Connect two tables, pile up books in the middle to act as a net, and buy a set of bats and ping pong balls)</li><li>Basketball (Attach a plastic basketball hoop to an office wall and get small plastic basketball)</li><li>Football (Create a goal in the space between two desks and get a soccer ball)</li><li>Darts (Hang a board on an office wall and get harmless soft darts)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These are only the basic things that software developers can do on their break from work. No matter which of these routine breakers you will choose, it will definitely turn out to be beneficial for your health. What is your favorite routine breaker as a software developer in an IT company?</p>

    <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Not all working days are the same for software developers. However, developers spend most of their time seated in front of a computer, coding all day (and night) and trying to meet predetermined deadlines. In almost all situations, web developers seem to behave as machines who only care about the task they need to complete for the day, and many of them believe that they can function solely on coffee. Thus, they do not pay enough attention to their health and are leading an unhealthy lifestyle. ]]></excerpt:encoded>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">How many times have you heard the phrase "content is king"? Too many times, I’m sure, if you are one of the content creators in the digital marketing world or any other Internet-related industry. That dazzling, almost prophetic statement originates from a 1996 essay by Bill Gates, the founder and former CEO of Microsoft. In the famous article, Gates argues that technology will transform the way we design, publish, and consume information:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">"One of the exciting things about the Internet is that anyone with a PC and a modem can publish whatever content they can create. In a sense, the Internet is the multimedia equivalent of the photocopier. It allows material to be duplicated at low cost, no matter the size of the audience. The Internet also allows information to be distributed worldwide at basically zero marginal cost to the publisher. Opportunities are remarkable, and many companies are laying plans to create content for the Internet."&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Slightly over two decades later, we are practically living that reality. That was one of the key reasons why we decided to contact Joshua Mendelssohn, the co-founder of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Factinate.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.factinate.com/" target="_blank">Factinate.com</a>, and asked him to shares his insights on online publishing, the content creation process, and what <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="IT services (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">IT services</a> provider such as Cosmic Development has to do with it.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How did you come up with the idea of creating Factinate.com? Please tell us more about it - what is the mission of your website, and who is it for?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Jeff Myers and I have always had a passion for facts and trivia, so we wanted to create a website dedicated to that. Factinate's mission is to share fun, educational facts about anything and everything that interests our readers. It's for trivia lovers everywhere, with a specific focus on folks interested in pop culture, history, and science.</p>

<h4>How is Factinate different from other fun-facts sites? What makes it unique?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We try to differentiate ourselves through the quality of our content. Our content creation process is meticulous, and we rely on seasoned career writers to make our articles shine. We have a wonderful team of editors that polish content, fact check, and inject a sense of fun into the writing. We pride ourselves on having high-quality, engaging images, and the team at Cosmic Development does an incredible job making sure our images are a cut above our competition.</p>

<h4><strong>How does Factinate.com function? Who makes your team?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our team of freelance article writers, which includes 20 or so seasoned writers, make the first drafts of all Factinate articles. We have a team of content creators, split between Toronto and Macedonia. The Toronto team (three full-time editors) focuses on editing and writing marketing copy for distribution. The Macedonia team (four full-time content creators), which is provided and managed by Cosmic Development, focuses on finding high-quality images, optimizing for SEO, and scheduling our Facebook page. We also have a team of media buyers who help make sure our content reaches trivia lovers everywhere. </p>

<h4>When did you realize that your project may benefit from outsourcing and staff augmentation services? What challenges were you experiencing before we first got in touch?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We were outsourcing to Cosmic Development since the beginning. At launch, we outsourced our development to Cosmic because they had the development skills that we didn't: the Cosmic team knows exactly how to build a website that looks great and can handle high volumes of traffic. Additionally, Cosmic is much more affordable than a senior developer based in Toronto.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As for content creation, we started working with Cosmic Development a bit later. Approximately six months in, our Toronto team found themselves burdened by time-consuming image insertion. The Cosmic content creators were extremely affordable, so having them take this off our plate was a no brainer. Having dedicated resources focused on images improved the quality of our images, and the team also ensured proper sourcing and crediting of all images.</p>

<h4>How did you learn about Cosmic Development? What convinced you to use our services over another solution?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We knew <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Chris Pavlovski (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Chris Pavlovski</a>, one of the founders of Cosmic Development and the founder and CEO of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank">Rumble.com</a>, from our time working at a previous employer, who was a Rumble client. The major drivers to choose Cosmic were cost and expertise.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What service does Cosmic Development perform for you, and how do you manage your augmentative team that operates from Macedonia?&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Currently, we have four full-time content creators provided by Cosmic Development (soon to be five!). The focus of the Cosmic team is on finding high-quality images, optimizing for SEO, and scheduling our Facebook page. Additionally, we often have the Cosmic team handle tasks that are labor-intensive and require critical thinking. We're currently adding new meta tags to our entire article database, and we have a Cosmic employee spearheading the initiative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As for management, some training is always required to teach an employee a new task. However, the Cosmic team learns quickly, and they are generally self-sufficient after the first training session, so neither Jeff nor I really need to manage them actively. We do have a simple process in place for tracking work--our editor in chief assigns articles and the Cosmic team track completion in a spreadsheet. Other than that, it's really hands-off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We also have bi-weekly company-wide check-ins, but these are less for active management and more to make sure everyone feels connected to other divisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What are the benefits for your business that came out as a result of our work together? If you have an opportunity to recommend us to others, what would you tell them?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It's tough to outline the "benefits" of working with Cosmic Development because they are so integral to our operation. In a certain sense, the benefit is that they allow our business to operate. To get into specifics, one of the major benefits is cost savings. Having our entire content team based in Canada would have been prohibitively expensive. Another major benefit is that they make our content better. The Cosmic employees working on Factinate are awesome, highly educated people who are very dedicated to the work they do, and this shows in the results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would certainly recommend Cosmic Development (and we have to many now-clients of Cosmic)! To folks in our industry (online publishing) or looking to get into the industry, Cosmic has unique expertise: they can build and manage the website you need. Additionally, Cosmic's business process employees and content creators could help so many businesses in a variety of industries. The economics just make sense, and the people are top-notch.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Women in Tech&nbsp;(WiT) is an international non-profit organization dedicated to helping women embrace technology. This organization plans and executes mentorships programs, networking, and other events that introduce technology to any women interested to learn and improve their technical skills.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We asked Monika Rizovska, Cosmic Development's Marketing and Communications Manager and Women in Tech Ambassador to tell us something more about her role in the tech industry and share the organization’s approach in empowering women in the tech sector.</p>

<h4><strong>What does it mean to be a Marketing and Communications Manager in an IT company such as Cosmic Development?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’m proud to be more than eight years in the IT industry, working and supporting young future tech leaders. As a Marketing and Communications Manager, I see my role in Cosmic Development also as a Happiness Engineer for all our 4 locations internally though my primary responsibility is to have a keen awareness of the local market and its trends. Then to develop clear and effective communication and <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/digital-marketing-and-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="digital marketing (opens in a new tab)">digital marketing</a> strategy that helps the company achieve the planned objectives locally and worldwide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic is all about people, and I love working with people. It’s impossible to accomplish great things without teamwork and coordination, particularly in a fast-growing industry such as ours. Cosmic Development is not keen on a traditional hierarchy. Our people are a family of go-getters and self-starters who love their jobs. They are responsible enthusiasts, ready to learn, grow, and prosper. We all work together towards achieving the same goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">What distinguishes Cosmic from the other companies where I worked is the flexible work time, the relationship with the people, the culture of freedom for creativity, and the support to go the extra mile. I am honored and grateful to be surrounded by great people with whom I can grow both as a professional. I learn a lot from my team. From Vladimir Novachki (our CTO) I got the “love bug” for FrontEnd development, and how to creative problem solving is used in programming. From Ryan Milnes (our CEO) I learn every day through our communication, especially about selling, branding, and aesthetics, from Matt (our CFO) how to plan carefully and from Anthony (our Director) to see the big picture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have complete support to spend time in supporting and helping our IT Community by sharing knowledge, connecting people, organizing events, hackathons, training, and being a mentor or judge at startup and tech conferences.</p>

<h4>Besides being the Marketing and Communication Manager at Cosmic Development, you have been more than 15 years actively engaged in other NGO organizations as well. You were chosen as one of the ten most inspiring women role models from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://eca.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/multimedia/2019/03/changing-the-rules-of-the-game-innovating-the-way-to-equality">UN Women</a>&nbsp;for the SEE region, an organization that advocates for women and girls in STEM (science, tech, engineering, and math). Could you tell us more about it?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am committed to empowering women in STEM for quite some time, through my previous NGO work previously, even without knowing or with that specific reason. My official involvement started as a board member at Girls in Tech, an initiative that aims to support girls and women who are on the crossroad of choosing their career. I believe that everyone should push their limits and learn new technologies. </p>

<h4><strong>How do you perceive the future growth of the IT industry in Macedonia?&nbsp;</strong><br></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am positive about the potential we have in the Balkans, as well as in the whole region of southeast Europe. Nowadays in Macedonia and Serbia, young children at the age of 6 or 7 are attending STEM courses and learn how to program robots, create websites, and even learn to code in Python. Slowly but surely, we are building skilled and highly qualified staff to solve global issues and build a better future. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are free meet-ups, workshops, conferences, and other events available to young people who are interested in starting a career in the IT sector. I hope to see continuous investments in the start-up community, an increasing number of coworking places, incubators and tech accelerators so the young professionals will be encouraged to take action and get involved in entrepreneurship as well. </p>

<h4><strong>What would you recommend to young women who are at the beginning of their careers?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There is no reason why young women shouldn't pursue careers in STEM if they want to. I advise everyone to be curious, persistent, to keep learning, and to keep investing in their knowledge. To accept challenges and to surround themselves with inspiring people who will help them grow. Last but not least, to embrace the opportunities to use their potential. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">People who are already familiar with the term CRM are those who had been using one or had a chance to be involved in the work of a <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/administration-and-virtual-assistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Business Development</a> or Sales department of a business/company. For everyone else, CRM is just another term that they’ll google.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Since this blog post is meant for beginners and experienced professionals alike, here’s a brief definition of a CRM system.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">CRM stands for Client Relationship Management, and a CRM system is a web/app technology for managing relationships and keeping track of the communication with potential and current clients.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What’s the Goal of Using a CRM? </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">While the main purpose of CRMs is to help us be more efficient in our communication with potential leads and clients, it also serves as a crucial tool for record tracking and if data are used in the right way, it plays a pivotal role in <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-scale-a-bu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">scaling up your business</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a Senior Business Consultant who has had the chance to use several different CRMs (like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pipedrive.com/" target="_blank">Pipedrive.com</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.zoho.com/" target="_blank">Zoho.com</a>) here, I’ll tell you more about my personal favorite so far i.e.,&nbsp;<a href="https://close.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Close.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>It’s an All-In-One CRM Platform <br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When using Close, you are covered in all areas as it is a platform with built-in emailing, calling and even texting. The platform enables you to send and receive emails and text messages, as well as to make calls within the same API (application program interface). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The most awesome part is that you can integrate the system with your existing email address and mobile number. Whether you are communicating with a client via email, mobile phone, or telephone, all you need to do is just log in to Close. You do it all from Close and under the client’s name is listed all the communication from day one till today. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2754,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/calling-hero-large-1024x606.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2754"/><figcaption><a href="https://close.com/brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As an addition, comes the personal notes that you can make. Goes without saying you can schedule tasks and create reminders and make sure you never miss a potential opportunity with a lead or a follow-up with an existing client.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Email Templates Option in Close CRM<br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anyone who has been reaching out to potential leads and who has been communicating with current clients as well can tell how much of a time-saver can be email templates. Be it just a paragraph or entire message, we often use previous messages word-for-word, or they serve as an inspiration to us. Either way, Close offers an option where you can create tailor-made templates with a subject line, and the only thing you need to adjust is the name of the person you are reaching out to. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In order to create a template, you need to go to the Settings section and click on the Email Templates option (it’s last under Communication). Then you write headlines, go on and type the message in the body part and hit the save button. Once the template is created, you can use it whenever you want. All you have to do is just select the one you want to use from the Choose a template bar that is next to the subject line.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2746,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/emailing-hero-large-1024x657.png" alt="CRM emailing" class="wp-image-2746"/><figcaption><a href="https://close.com/brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Customized Reporting</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Maybe the most important feature that a CRM can have. As in any business activity, we need to have means that track our performance. With Close, you can export several types of reports that are crucial for your strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>Activity Overview  </strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It gives a better look and understanding of the overall team’s performance. There’s an option for you to customize the metrics and see the results of those activities that are of your interest. There’s also a leader board option that shows you who of the team performed best following the metrics of your choice. You can also compare the overall performance of the team to a previous period of time.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>Activity Comparison Report </strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This report offers an overview of the individual performance of all team members in the form of a spreadsheet. Again there are over 50 activity metrics to choose from and to be tracked so that you can get a fully customized report on how individual members contribute to the overall success. Just like with the Activity Overview report, you can compare the results to the previous period and opt for a filter-by-user option or smart view. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2750,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/reporting-hero-large-1024x601.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2750"/><figcaption><a href="https://close.com/brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>What else?</strong> </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are available three more options that one can find very useful when evaluating the sales and client management efforts. Let’s not forget the <strong>Status Change</strong>, <strong>Explorer</strong>, and <strong>Sent Emails</strong> reporting sections. The status change report gives you insights on how leads change through the process and stats like how many leads were qualified over a certain period, how many turned out to be bad fits, how many were closed etc. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The explorer is there to answer all of your questions that can’t be answered by other types of reporting. This type of report can show all the leads you have by industry or existing clients only by industry, or you can graph really anything; like leads created by certain users or certain activity by the particular user. All you have to do is just select the preferred metrics and see the graph for it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Last but not least comes the sent emails option that gives you precise data on how your emails performed over time. What templates work best and what doesn’t live up to the expectations. You can see the open rate and response rate, which gives you a clear picture of how email communication is doing over a given period of time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As I mentioned, all reports in Close can be exported at any time, and they come in the form of CVS or JSON file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Excellent Customer Support </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At the very beginning, when I first started using Close I was limited to using it just for keeping track of new leads and making reminders on who shall I contact next. I tested sending emails from the app, but I didn’t like the fact that next to my name there was a note <strong>via close.com</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":2809,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Email-with-via-Close-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2809"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Since I thought nothing could be done about it, I limited my use just for entering new leads (I loved how it automatically checks for duplicates) and creating alerts. Not a full month later a note popped up asking if I want to rate the app. I hit #3 out of 5 explaining what bothered me. Within 24 hours, I was contacted by a support rep from Close explaining that the note will disappear once I sync my email with the platform. I followed their instructions, and voila magic happened! I noticed that the whole email correspondence now was available on the platform and no matter if I sent an email from my Gmail account or Close it appeared in both places. Also, I was able to use the templates and send even bulk emails (when appropriate) from the app. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Integration with Other Apps </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Close.com can be integrated with a variety of apps that you are already using for communication, marketing, prospecting, analysis, and reporting, etc.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here I’ll mention just a handful that can be easily integrated with the platform:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Slack</li><li>MailChimp</li><li>Zendesk</li><li>Marketo</li><li>Shopify</li><li>Eventbrite (among many others) </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To sum it up. All of the above is in a way a personal testimonial of one individual user and for all who want to learn more about Close feel free to visit their <a href="https://close.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">website</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://close.com/compare/" target="_blank">read more about Close vs. other apps </a>and see what <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://close.com/pricing/" target="_blank">the pricing options</a> are. The only setback may be that this awesome app is not free. Still, for all potential users, there is an option to sign-up for a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.close.com/signup/" target="_blank">14-day free trial</a> with no credit card required. Also, the good news is that there are discounts that are offered only to qualifying users based on their specific features like the team’s size and budget. Feel free to contact Close sales team for more detailed information.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Is going to a conference a smart investment in one's professional development or is attendance at such an event just an unnecessary waste of resources (like time and money to start with)? This may easily be one of those questions with a million-dollar price tag attached to it, and no simple answer. One might argue that the usefulness of a conference largely depends on what an attendee chooses to do there, so its actual value is not that simple to measure.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The summits, conferences, and workshops, just like many other things in life, are nothing more (nor less) than what we make of them. They can be seen as valuable assets for everyone eager to learn and increase their expertise in a specific field, gain new experiences, and socialize with people from a similar line of work.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the other hand, going to a conference can be a real nightmare for those who are not willing to break out of their comfort zone (also known as the comfortable and safe space behind the computer screen that doesn't require too much social interaction with others). So, let's tackle some of the key reasons why one should attend conferences when the opportunity presents itself and how to make the most of it.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">From where we stand, we see each conference as a chance to learn from the leading experts in the industry and to connect with peers through meet-ups and networking events within the conference. Therefore, the best advice we have to offer is this: pick the next exciting industry event and go:</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Growing new ideas is not an easy task, especially if you are a highly profiled professional<em> </em>in a particular field. The continuous dealing with more or less similar challenges tends to narrow our view over the course of time. The repetitive processes and operations in any given framework may contribute to perfecting specific skill sets, but they also bring the risk of losing the big picture.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, going to a conference and hearing from other experts what they do and how they approach specific problems may shake you up and give you a new boost of creativity. Finding a new perspective on old issues is always the best way to go. It may not be the safest path to take, but it's certainly an exciting one!</p>

<h2 id="Learn">Learn Something New at a Conference<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Conferences are awesome places to find out about the latest achievements in your industry and learn new stuff step by step and in detail. There could be some new technology or technique that you were not aware of before or some brand new piece of equipment that could boost off your business.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apart from a few big names and some of the freshest successful faces in your niche, every conference will offer some added value. There could be an expo floor where the gold and silver sponsors and other companies that support the event will have various tools and gadgets displayed on their booths or some specialized workshop or training you can attend for free. It's always fantastic to get first-hand experience and be able to ask questions and get real-time answers about the given topic.&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Stand">Don't You Just Stand Still<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Every conference is the perfect chance to meet experts and your industry peers that<em> </em>may help you with overcoming challenges and dilemmas. If you are too shy or restrained to ask questions during the sessions, you can always find a way to approach people you want to meet in a less formal atmosphere during the break or even at the conference bar or party. You will be amazed by how many of them are interested in what you do and willing to help.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Even if it's just about grabbing the opportunity to take a selfie with someone you admire, do it! They might ask you a question and open a dialogue. You never know what might come out of it - you may gain some useful insights into the industry, maybe find your new business mentor or even a new business partner. Whatever happens, you’ll come out as a winner for sure!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Hi">Say "Hi" to the World<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Surprisingly, even those people who seem super confident and extremely self-assured actually have their own doubts about their talents, abilities, and strengths. It's perfectly fine not to feel like being at the top of the game all the time. But, that doesn't mean you should hide from the crowd. On the contrary -&nbsp; introducing yourself and your work to the people you've never met before may only increase your chances of becoming a better version of yourself!<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There is no better training ground for stepping out and saying "Hi" to the world than the industry conferences. You already have more than a few things in common with most of the attendees. You definitely share similar if not the same interests, compatible aspirations, and valuable experiences worth learning about.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2 id="Pitch">Pitch Your (Business) Idea to Industry Experts  </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Conferences are undoubtedly the best places where you can simply cut to the chase and talk to people without looking (nor feeling) awkward. Talking and sharing is why people gather there to start with, so don't waste such an opportunity.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have a business idea that is directly or indirectly related to the conference topic(s), you may want to test it by pitching it to people around you and asking them what they think about it. In case you feel worried someone might "borrow" your original concept, try to come up with a story that you are comfortable with sharing, and see how people react to it. Once you gain more trust in people, you could try and open up a bit - maybe someone will actually get hooked on your idea and offer real and concrete help.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2 id="Horizons">Keep Broadening Your Horizons<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There's nothing wrong with being an amazingly skillful, highly specialized professional who knows how to do their job better than others. Moreover, a lot of companies and business owners sincerely appreciate having such individuals on their staff. These people simply get the job done, and that's what matters in business, right? We wonder, is that enough?&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We strongly believe in the importance of broadening the horizons and expanding the field of interest. That doesn't necessarily mean taking a U-turn in your career, but rather leaving your open door for new experiences, new approaches, new insights - the new and improved version of yourself. Inspiring conference speakers can really initiate that change within you.<br></p>

<h2 id="Different">Do Something Different<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Attending a conference is an excellent opportunity to get out of your daily routine and try out something you've never done before. Most professional events have a little gap in the schedule that allows people to sneak out of the venue and do something different. Use that and go to a museum, for example, even if that's not your thing. Take a walk and explore the local area, or be even more adventurer&nbsp; - book a visit to the tallest building in the city and face your fear of heights! Why not?<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Doing things for the first time is probably the best thing you can do for yourself. It's a kind of experience that has an important impact on many levels - it boosts self-confidence, induces self-esteem, and gives such a powerful spiritual uplift.<br></p>

<h2 id="Enthusiasm">Power-Up Your Enthusiasm with Conference Peers</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">People who are ready to take some time away from their regular job to learn something new are the new best friends to anyone who wants to get to the next level in their lives both personally and professionally. Conferences gather such people.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The energy of like-minded individuals working together towards the same or similar goals is a mighty force, and you may want to use it to grow your own potentials. The exchange that happens at conferences has the power to renew your strength and restore enthusiasm. Even if nothing concrete happens there, the intangible benefits will be visible in the long-term.<br></p>

<h2 id="Party">Get the Party Started<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition to gaining new information about the latest achievements in the field of professional interest and hardcore networking, conferences can be quite beneficial in other ways as well. They can be a whole lot of fun!<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Almost every conference out there in the world ends with a party. Don't skip it. No matter how tired you might feel after two days of sessions and workshops, make an effort, and go party with your peers. Take advantage of the informal atmosphere and chat with people in a more casual way. Sometimes even the small talks can open the door to big opportunities and quality conversations. Give it a try.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2 id="Sharing">Conference Follow Up: <strong>Sharing is Caring</strong><br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Once you get back from an exciting conference, all empowered and motivated, try to hold on to that feeling for as long as you can and share it with others. Take a lunch break with your colleagues and tell them all about it - share your new discoveries, inform them about what you've found out about the latest breakthroughs in your industry, offer your insights and fresh ideas, and continue to network within your organization.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The more you share, the more you'll get back.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Giving back to the community is one of<em> </em>our guiding principles, and that's why we never miss an opportunity to visit a conference, and whenever possible, take an active part in it.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In difficult times such as the one we are facing, we often wonder how to help people and how to make their lives better. Many organizations throughout the world have raised initiatives for helping people to overcome the COVID-19 situation. We have witnessed many new ways how to help people in times of pandemic outbreak and we have seen a rise in the humanitarian side of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Following the Canadian examples for helping people and organizations during the Coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://ways2help.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Ways2Help (opens in a new tab)">Ways2Help</a> is an initiative for creating a platform that teaches others how to help people in such difficult times. Cosmic Development took part in this initiative as a mentor of the Ways2Help platform creators and helped in the process of creation of the idea for the platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The idea for Ways2Help was born during the Startup Weekend COVID-19 edition 2020. During this event, the platform creators realized that people all over the world are facing an increase in unemployment and poverty as a result of the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, as well as due to the social distancing measures and the limited resources available. Ways2Help is an initiative that is created for the sole purpose of providing help to other people, in addition to the actions that the organizations in charge are taking. The Ways2Help initiative created one universal platform where people can donate, volunteer, or pay the bills of another person.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Platform for Charity Organizations “Ways2Help” won the 10th “Startup Weekend Skopje”</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Many online mediums wrote about this event and <a href="https://inovativnost.mk/2020/05/01/%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">here</a> you can find the link in Macedonian language that describes in further detail the development of the platform for charity organizations “Ways2Help” that won the 10th edition of the “Startup Weekend Skopje” event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Ways2Help is a platform that connects charity organizations with people who have the need for help. This platform won the first prize on the 10th “Startup Weekend Skopje - Covid-19 edition”, which was held from April 24-26 2020 as an online event for the first time till now.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The idea behind “Ways2Help” is to create a platform for all institutions and non-governmental organizations in order to help the people at risk during the Coronavirus crisis. In addition to the possibilities for donation, this platform also offers options for volunteer work and regular payment of the staging accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">“Neighbours” won second place. This is a platform for connecting the members of a local community for solidarity action, donations, and services to those most at risk, in order to encourage local volunteers and to connect them with those at risk in the safest way possible.&nbsp; The third place went to “QRCrew” - a shopping application that will help local businesses by connecting them to their customers via QR technology. The delivery will be ecologically friendly, including bicycle deliverers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The 10th edition of the “Startup Weekend Skopje” focused on solutions for the challenges and consequences of COVID-19. This event presented a unique opportunity for those who have a business idea about how they can help the society deal with the challenges that this pandemic caused, enabling them to form a team, get support from experts, and develop the idea for a duration of only 54 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The event was held entirely online and in it participated entrepreneurs, students, and enthusiasts from all over the country. The 40 participants grouped together in eight teams and were supported by 26 competent mentors and four judges. Out of the eight ideas, only five continued in the finale and the best ideas were chosen out of those five finalists.</p>

<h2>How can Global Tech for Good Help</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are several areas where tech can improve well being and smooth disruption.

The following technologies have proven Global Tech for Good applicability:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Artificial Intelligence and analytics include natural language processing, and it can be used to tailor classes to individual students, adjust the level of understanding, and measure the student's progress. Artificial Intelligence can also shorten administration for teachers, freeing up their time for more interaction and communication.</li><li>Platforms for interaction, including mobile applications, are crucial.

<h2>The Impact of Technology on the Process of Digitalization</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Technology has a significant impact on improving the overall process of digitalization, improving our knowledge sharing and education together with our health and wellbeing. The possibilities range from AI-powered sensors to personal tracking of each lifestyle change that is monitored via health, and the improvements can be tracked.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">CSR should be built as a core value of every company.

<p class="has-medium-font-size">No one could have ever imagined what 2020 had in store. The novel Covid-19 virus turning into a global pandemic has shaken the world. Within months, it has afflicted every country, every industry, and every individual on the Planet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Still, the IT industry continued to be ahead of all the disruptions caused by the new reality. Digital transformation and technology breakthroughs continued to occur at the same speedy pace. They just took a slightly different course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here we cover five tech trends that are moving into 2021 and the years to come: </p>

<h2 id="internetofbehaviors"> Internet of Behaviors </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To better explain the Internet of Behaviors (IoB) trend, we have to start with the Internet of Things (IoT) first. The two are so related that we can not explain one without the other. While IoT represents a network of interconnected devices that gather and exchange information and data over the Internet, IoB makes sense and alters human behaviors by using data. The Internet of Behaviors emerged thanks to the rising number of technologies that collect data of day-to-day activities that stem from both the digital and physical world. At the same time, the main focus of IoB is to digest and use this data to influence human behavior via feedback loops. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">We live in a world where we use smart devices connected to various apps and accounts on the Internet, and tracking our behaviors is not that odd. It more comes as the next logical step in technology. For example, we shouldn't be surprised if our driving habits, from fast driving to making sudden turns and breaking, is monitored by telematics. IoB comes into play when companies are using this data to improve driver performance and safety. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This information is gold for how companies plan their development, marketing, and sales strategies and will be widely used in the upcoming years. IoB can gather and process data from many sources ranging from smartphones, wearable devices, computers, in-home assistants and cameras, and all smart devices in general. As much as this is a good thing for companies improving user experience, this trend walks on a thin line with users' privacy and personal data protection. Thus, its future development will be tightly related to the local privacy and data protection laws, as they vary from country to country and region to region.  </p>

<ul><li>Companies will reduce latency thanks to the chance to be physically closer to the cloud servers they are using.</li><li>They will cut down on data-storage costs as they will use the public cloud after all.</li><li>They will easily remain in full compliance with data sovereignty laws as data can be stored in the country it was initially produced.</li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/why-many-choose-rumble-video-player-over-youtube/">Rumble</a>&nbsp;is one of the world’s fastest-growing video sharing platforms and one of Canada’s fastest-growing tech companies. In the last year, <a href="https://rumble.com/">Rumble</a> has experienced explosive growth and become a strong competitor to YouTube. Rumble screens, hosts, licenses, and distributes streaming videos around the world. It allows small and big content creators to make money online with their monetized videos and gives brands a safe place to advertise online. Sourcing content for an increasingly popular video platform like Rumble is not easy, but Ivana and her colleagues managed to keep high standards and quality.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Efficiently managing and sustain a company's growth can't be done without dedicated and hard-working employees. In today's interview, we've asked Ivana to share her experience and personal career development path within Rumble.

<h3><strong>As one of the first people to join Rumble in Cosmic Development’s office in Bitola, Can you tell us how it all started?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Joining Rumble/Cosmic Development was one of the most exciting and interesting experiences in my life.<br> As an Economist, I never thought that I would work in an IT company. It all started in 2015 when one of my friends who worked in Cosmic (it was a pretty new company in my hometown at that time) told me that they are hiring new people and that I should apply for a job. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the very beginning, I was skeptical because I never imagined that I would get the job. I thought you need strong ties and friends to be a part of this company. It turned out I was mistaken; it was one of the easiest things that I have gotten in my whole life. I had the coolest and, at the same time, the most stressful interview with our CEO Chris Pavlovski, which ended up most positively. I got the job! Being a part of this company through all these years is something that I could never regret. To be part of this company feels like being a part of a happy family.</p>

<h3>What’s your role at Rumble? What was your starting position and how it changed through the years?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Through the years, I’ve been part of several teams at Rumble. In the beginning, I was a part of the <strong>Business Development</strong> team and I started working as a <strong>Publisher Account Strategist.</strong> My main job was finding big and attractive publishers that would be posting our videos on their sites. That brings value not only to the content creators but to the publishers as well. As the platform grew over the past years and management started doing some internal transformations, I got the chance to work in different sectors that helped me understand how the platform works. That was a new profession not only to me but to everyone on the team. Video Marketing was an industry that I never imagined could exist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working in different sectors through the years brought me to the position of <strong>Content Manager</strong>. My primary responsibilities include getting on track with the latest trending videos, finding videos that have the potential to become viral, and getting in touch with huge YouTube Content Creators. All with the main purpose of bringing them to the Rumble platform. Attracting huge content creators to the platform and getting in touch with public figures and famous media and TV companies from all around the world is the most exciting part of my job. It’s like a dream!</p>

<h3>How do you find managing a team that is spread across different locations?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At first sight, managing a geographically dispersed team seems to be very difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, my additional training, technological advancements, and working for a company like Rumble made the impossible possible. Rumble is a company that offers numerous possibilities for professional development like conferences, workshops, and seminars. Also, it organizes travels and in-person meetings that overcome the physical barriers between the teams and makes it easier to become familiar with the organizational culture. That allows for better communication and synergy between employees. I was lucky that I had the chance to travel and work in Rumble’s offices in <strong>Skopje</strong>, <strong>Belgrade</strong>, and <strong>Toronto</strong>, the most exciting for me. I got to know all of Rumble’s employees, and we overcame all the challenges of remote work management.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is a great pleasure to be part of the Rumble team, and If I got a chance to choose the company again, I’d definitely choose the Content Manager position at Rumble. “When one finds a good great company to work, it really changes the life to the best. “</p>

<h3>How do you keep up with the latest trends in your industry?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The essence of my job as Content Manager is researching and identifying emerging trends, so it is only natural that we quickly come into contact with the latest trends in our industry. The advancements in technology and the availability of accessible and high-quality information helps us to keep up with the competition. This industry is based on competitive analysis, which enables us to determine what’s new on the market.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Developing personal soft skills is one of the current trending topics among IT professionals. As we move forward with our careers, we realize that technical skills are not the only qualities we need to possess when working as software developers. Soft skills are just as important as technical skills because they determine the working atmosphere, work ethic, and teamwork and communication.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In certain situations, <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">web developers</a> can be ultra-intelligent and code without any effort. However, when working as part of a team of developers, technical skills can prove to be insufficient, especially if some of the co-workers have difficult personalities. Therefore, IT professionals need to develop the following soft skills:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="#Time">Time Management</a></li><li><a href="#Task">Task Organization</a></li><li><a href="#Communication">Communication</a></li><li><a href="#Adaptability">Open-Mindedness and Adaptability</a></li><li><a href="#Teamwork">Teamwork</a></li><li><a href="#Critical">Critical Thinking and Admitting Your Mistakes</a></li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Time">Time Management: One of the Most Important Soft Skills</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">During working hours, software developers have the freedom to manage their time and prioritize their tasks according to their needs. Being able to successfully manage their time means that they have one of the basic soft skills that every employee must develop as part of their work ethic. A good way to manage your time and stay focused is by creating to-do lists or by using a time management technique, such as the Pomodoro.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Every one of us has once been found in a situation of being stuck in reading memes and watching videos for much longer than one should. That is why we must develop a soft skill for time management and organize both our tasks and activities, as well as our free time. As part of the time management strategy, we can learn how to maximize our work efficiency and how to minimize the time spent on procrastination. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, having developed time management soft skills also means knowing when to stop working. Staying overtime and working all night long may prove to be unhealthy on a long-term basis. Therefore, software developers need to learn <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-software-developers-break-their-daily-work-routine/">how to break their daily work routine</a>, if they want to be efficient in their work.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Task">Task Organization Goes Hand-In-Hand with Time Management<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another aspect of the time management strategy is to know how to organize your tasks and how to create a work plan. The list of must-have soft skills includes also a good organization of tasks and activities. In other words, workers who want to become impeccable IT professionals need to learn how to plan, prioritize and delegate their tasks appropriately.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software developers who plan and prioritize their tasks by importance, then delegate them to other colleagues, will be able to deliver project deadlines on time. To do so, they need to have excellent organizational soft skills that will help them to manage their time accordingly and to eliminate any bad habits they might have.</p>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Communication">Communication is the Master of Soft Skills</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Communication is one of the key soft skills for software developers as well as for other employees, regardless of their position in a company. It is a well-known fact that understanding and communicating is not easy, especially when we try to explain something but the other person understands it in another way. Therefore, as part of the mandatory soft skills for programmers is to know how to communicate both with the company’s managers and with other co-workers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software developers are expected to communicate their work and assignments with their managers in order to get the necessary acknowledgment and their work performance evaluated. Managers usually create their own impressions of each team member by observing their performance. Moreover, these are the five aspects of the employees’ behavior that managers mostly pay attention to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Direct communication (in meetings and on projects)</li><li>Punctuation on meetings</li><li>Prepared presentations</li><li>Communication with other team members</li><li>Other people talking about you</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apart from the communication with managers, when developing soft skills such as communication skills, you need to learn how to communicate with other co-workers as well. In order to communicate effectively with your co-workers, you need to first speak clearly and with confidence, then listen to what others are saying and have patience when another person is speaking. One of the soft skills for software developers is to know how to communicate with other team members and explain to them in a clear way why you agree or disagree with them. Moreover, you will also have to know how to explain technical details to people who do not understand anything about the developers’ world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Adaptability">Open-Mindedness and Adaptability are Keys for Understanding<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software developers need to be open-minded and able to adapt to the dynamics of their jobs. As one of the soft skills for developers, open-mindedness is crucial when listening to the ideas of others. By being open-minded, we can learn new things, build new ideas, accomplish the tasks successfully, and lower the number of unnecessary debates and conversations during meetings. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Open-mindedness helps us set aside our opinions, listen to other’s ideas without judgment and accept those ideas even when we do not like them at first. We need to keep our minds open to new ideas that come from either a team member or another employee in the company, regardless of whether we believe that it actually might work out or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition to being open-minded, software developers need to also adapt easily to changes within the company. Adaptability as one of the most important soft skills is needed in situations when technology is fastly developing and when programmers are expected to adapt to the changes in both software and hardware. To prove that they are adaptable, programmers can try and prove their experience through the hard skills they possess. Moreover, they may also list new programming languages or add statistics to their work experience in order to better prove their level of adaptability.<br></p>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Teamwork">Teamwork is the Dreamwork</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the main soft skills for software developers is to be able to work as part of a team of programmers who want to be successful. Being part of a team may not always prove to be positive, but a company can become more successful when the employees’ ideas differ.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Showing empathy towards other team members is an essential part of the teamwork. Trying to understand other people and their beliefs and characteristics may turn out beneficial. Web developers may show their empathy in various ways. Programmers who are empathic can try and see things from other points of view by listening to other team member’s ideas. Moreover, they need to provide feedback on various topics in an empathic manner with positive feedback, even when they do not agree with the idea and want to give negative comments. They should not make decisions based solely on their personal preferences. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The key to success when working as part of a team is to help each other, be approachable and be patient. Not being approachable or helpful may cause dislike or disbalance in the team and people may stop asking for help in the future, which eventually will turn into a bigger problem. Moreover, being patient is crucial when working with people who do not have the same mindset as you do. Software developers need to show patience when explaining things about programming to people who do not understand its difficulty, or when they are required to do something without having enough time given. </p>

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Critical">Embrace Critical Thinking and Learn to Admit Your Mistakes<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Not many people can say that they can accept criticism with ease or that they can admit a mistake in the work. Avoiding to admit your mistakes may result in committing further similar mistakes in the future. In such situations, you need to stop for a moment, think critically about the situation, admit your mistakes and admit responsibility. You can do so by accepting that things went wrong and find a way to fix the problem, instead of trying to hide it. Admitting a mistake and taking responsibility will help you resolve the issue on time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When writing clean code, developers may need to use critical thinking as one of the most needed soft skills, especially if they have several potential solutions to their current challenges. To solve the problem and assess those solutions, they will have to use both their creative and critical thinking.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">All soft skills complement each other and the developers who possess most of them, if not all, are considered as employees with strong leadership potential. Which of these soft skills you have? Which ones you would like to improve?<br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Vladimir Novachki is the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Cosmic Development. With over ten years of experience in the IT sector, Vladimir has a lot to say when it comes to building high-performance, scalable web applications which can handle hundreds of thousands of real-time users. He is directly involved in the implementation of solutions for large enterprises, some of which are ranked in the top 5 websites in the world in their field, such as Little Things and&nbsp; AFV, among others. Vladimir is also the creator of one of the first fully Macedonian mobile applications. He is genuinely passionate about hardware prototyping and blockchain technology, as well. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Curious about his success, we asked our CTO to share his story and experiences - how did he make his rags-to-riches professional dream come true, what were some of the key steps in his career to this point, and what has he learned along the way. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this interview, Vladimir also talks about the learning process. Many young people today are keen to dive into the ocean of the IT industry, but they are unsure of how and where to start. Should they learn in computer classes or on the internet? Or should they perhaps enroll in some specialized programs? Vladimir explains what is the best combination in his opinion and advises his future colleagues to be persistent and keep going, to stay updated with the latest technologies and to try not to focus on the code alone, but also the bigger picture.<br></p>

<h2>Your path from intern to CTO is more than inspiring. Could you please tell us how it all started?&nbsp;<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Like many great things in life, this one started by chance. One of the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Cosmic Development's founders (opens in a new tab)">Cosmic Development's founders</a> gave a speech at the university, and I remember being so inspired by what he had to say about the IT industry. I instantly recognized Cosmic as the right place for me and decided to apply for their very first internship program. It turned out there were more than 50 undergraduates who applied for that program as well, but I was fortunate enough to be one of the four chosen interns. We were given the opportunity to work on real applications used by lots of people. The whole experience was truly priceless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After finishing the internship program, there was mutual interest between the company and myself to continue working there as a full-time employee and to keep working on those projects. Over the years of continuous learning and improvement of my skill set, I was empowered to nurture and grow my career in the company and consequently became the CTO. I guess I was lucky enough to find the perfect fit company right from the start. <br></p>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Being a CTO is a much more responsible position than the ones you held before. How do you cope with the challenges of your job?<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As CTO, I am responsible not only for the technological requirements and operations but also for managing and providing guidance to the rest of the programmers in our company. CTOs are required to have extensive knowledge of the technologies and processes of software development, along with a company's strategy, and I'm doing my best to ensure that Cosmic Development is always at the top of the game. Another set of my responsibilities include regular communication with all of our clients and pretty frequent business trips. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, all of that comes naturally, because as a <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software development  (opens in a new tab)">software development </a>company, the business strategy largely depends on the technology we use, and I feel confident in the choices we (my team and myself as the CTO) make in that area. We work with big clients who are in the world's top 5 in their fields, such as <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.littlethings.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1ghZrqtvDKaRt59LpsNa_ZcbDmfjyQJ1LXMNkjZXJrCMB-WaVkG6ryIOU&amp;h=AT2Fgc9yZ7fQGvxP2srU17ARoZWcOMwatnFHAEbEh8edP9xXjxkdwvjo7fDhUP1ekOM-t1wEZcUQCM5EZpXhhjX1nYbDiafZBZrmoiFcbmZ8tTsbJklpKbtjiJqnjXgB5XNg6wPQ">Little Things</a>, <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fafv.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0448f1Xm04trfEAE0yOI1ZGFasiDjc9ErbE84k7RZA-r8mwYgIP0B4R7k&amp;h=AT1ZNQosMKTZejDCbtijir-EkyG5QFIRRxN-KxdOoXGRzSkE_Q2YSpTGPMDe3kFQ8-ArAMi9twXPkuoXiDJsNP27LXg2gJXdZhFgXKW_omBjrd1BChrFCijlg0oKbuqhl_OmYMGO">AFV</a>, and <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Frumble.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0jT6NYMpM59jbyT0a_-0gHCb_e9lhz8uergiuhBj2CanDHdmqGKD0XPeQ&amp;h=AT17IWmN107m6xlVLlmS37Dbx8l-Og_Yf1xD51vj8VxuRoqW2Dy_d52cal0Cifan8Y_1BFRFuwT1PdPNXIKeDSddYMoA8zLSAyWVLhR7Nc8kw8XsTRjA0NEvDamJN6kmrhvTcUYJ">Rumble</a>.

<h2>The openness and the ease with which you talk about work is impressive. It sounds like you truly love what you do! When did you discover your passion for programming?&nbsp;<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My interest in programming dates back to my elementary school years. I believe it was 2001 when I came across a book called "Introduction to Computer Programming (Computers &amp; Electronics)" by Brian Reffin Smith. It was an illustrated children's guide to computer programming, and I was hooked instantly. I remember learning about the basics of the programming language BASIC from it. My access to the Internet was quite limited at that time, so a "no computer needed" programming book, or in my case - "no internet needed" guideline was much appreciated. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition to a lack of Internet access, we didn't have informatics at school at all. Still, we had magazines like "PC Info" and "Plugin," so thanks to those publications, I've learned a lot about Linux and Visual Basic. Then I decided to enroll in high school specialized in computer science and learned about the architecture of computer systems, how to code in Pascal, how to use the environment of Delphi, etc. I also dedicated much of my free time to study HTML on my own, and in 2002, I created my first website. I used the premises of Internet Clubs in Skopje and a bunch of floppy disks to upload and update it. The fun thing is - the website is still alive, and you can check it out <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fvladimir.novachki.com%2Fnozo.cjb.net%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3HYRuSHIGrwb3pDJQ0vAjKGsIF6Yluhpf-xLJe3ZQanSfB1pbGj7mmTgw&amp;h=AT1QDB4qOvr8TmPf7EPtlrk2efXEatpjjqzYyhfgRhPSoP9JWrOXJdMSk1bA5IopVn1G_z0IAg4I_hpu62w_i4tVla8HcVtJJu-EM7TVOmt8TA137ULfddONzDm-ubEl3pbjtHY5">here</a>.

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>That really sounds exciting! What happened next?<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My passion for computers and computer coding had reached a whole new level when I began university studies. I took a much more serious approach to programming at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies. I learned a lot about advanced concepts - from the development of the application for the command line, web and mobile applications, some simple hardware modules, all the way to advanced hardware prototyping. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, the process of learning and training did not end with my formal studies, but on the contrary - it gave me a sound basis for constant upgrading of knowledge and skills. I still keep learning with every new project I'm involved with.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2>Thank you for these insightful answers. But, if we want to summarize, what would be your advice to young people who want to go your way?&nbsp;<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There is no magic wand that could make a top-notch programmer out of you (let alone CTO) if you are not a hundred percent dedicated to it. If you really want to succeed in this game, you better prepare yourself for continually expanding your knowledge and upgrading your in-depth understanding of the newest technologies.&nbsp; <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My best advice to young people is to stay curious and open to new things. The era of being an expert in one technology is long gone. Nowadays, everyone who wants to call him or herself a good developer must stay flexible - those who get too attached to a specific syntax or programming language are doomed to fail in this ever-changing world of the IT industry. Young developers should try and focus more on concepts, structures, and algorithms. They need to see the big picture and to know how to connect all of the dots to achieve the best possible results. </p>

<h2>How do you stay updated with news from the industry and the latest trends? What are your favorite sources of information?&nbsp;<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are many useful websites where software developers and other IT professionals can learn about what's going on in the industry, dig up some helpful, practical advice, post a question to the community or share their thoughts and ideas with the world. Some of my favorites are the Practical Dev, Hacker News, Reddit, among many others. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I also like to read random articles on business and other less "hardcore" work-related CTO and developers' topics. Sometimes the change of subject or better-said focus helps us escape the vicious circle of (same old) thought and see things more clearly when solving a specific problem. My favorite go-to place for such reads is, in fact, our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="blog (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a> as it offers some pretty great advice on things that are quite important but less considered in the developers' world, like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="breaking a daily work routine (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-software-developers-break-their-daily-work-routine/" target="_blank">breaking a daily work routine</a>, communication tips, and other <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="soft skills  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-soft-skills-for-software-developers/" target="_blank">soft skills </a>advice.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p>

<h2>Let’s stick to hard skills for a bit. If you have to name your favorite technology stack, what would that be and why? What tools do you find the most useful?<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We should not be focused on one stack or technology. With the usage of microservices, we can break down the system into different services. Each service can be developed with the most appropriate technology for the problem that the service is solving.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If I have to choose one stack, that would be LEMP. Although it might sound outdated, the fact is that many of the world's biggest websites are developed on top of this stack shows how powerful LEMP truly is. We should not forget that Laravel is one of the most popular web frameworks with the most significant community.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2>How do you see the future of software development and what directions should your younger colleagues take when it comes to new technologies?&nbsp;<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to new technologies, there are a lot of different directions. We should be focused on technologies that can solve daily life problems.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For instance, electric scooters have completely changed the micro-mobility market. However, they are facing one big problem - the increased number of accidents on a daily basis. Technologies like IoT and machine learning can be used to solve this problem. All scooters can be equipped with GPS, accelerometer, and other IoT sensors. All collected data from these sensors could use machine learning to interpret the habits of their riders and notify the rider of dangerous practices. This is just one example where modern technologies can solve our daily life problems.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When we are talking about the future in the new technologies, we should not forget about blockchain. When I say "blockchain," I do not mean Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain allows us to store a large amount of data safely and can be a substitute for complex software systems. It can be used in any area such as banking, education, health, government, etc.<br></p>

<h2>Any last tips (from the CTO perspective) on how to stay motivated and on track with career goals? <br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I firmly believe that having the right work-life balance is the key. No matter what you do, always look for a balance between your professional work and your free time. Taking time for yourself to do what makes you truly happy will give your brain a chance to reboot and prepare itself for new challenges.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you are a programmer like I am, try not to focus on code alone, but work on your other skills as well. Those so-called soft skills or interpersonal skills will help you to deal with, let's say, disagreements about unforeseen requirements, tight deadlines, and pressure to maximize productivity.&nbsp; If you are interested in this topic, make sure to read "The Clean Coder" and "The Software Craftsman" books. It could help you immensely.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Stay connected to people and keep building relationships. Open up yourself, do the networking, attend conferences, and meet-ups. Use every chance to introduce yourself to new people and always share your knowledge, experience, and ideas with others. Give back to the community what you've been given, and you'll be amazed how far that can take you.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h5>by Panajota Gushkova</h5>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you think communication skills aren’t very important for the IT pro, think again. While IT professionals would gladly spend all day "talking" to computers in various languages, holding vast programs and datasets in their heads and solving interesting problems, today’s IT jobs require good communication skills in addition to the mandatory excellent tech skills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Take a look at any job posting - excellent communication skills are likely to be among the qualifications that employers highly value.&nbsp;Even if the job requires limited interaction with the public, these interpersonal skills help you relate, persuade, lead, negotiate and express yourself when speaking and writing. They help you build strong collaborative relationships with your coworkers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Regardless of whether you are working in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software development (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software development</a> department or your interest tends more to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="digital marketing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/digital-marketing-and-sales/" target="_blank">digital marketing</a>, here are eight tips on how to improve your communication skills beyond the level of bits and bytes:</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="listen"><strong>Learn to Listen </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you want to give the correct answer, you have to give the correct attention to the question. Listening doesn’t just happen. Do not mix the act of listening with the act of hearing. Listening is the action that leads to understanding, while hearing is one of our senses. Listening is an active process in which you consciously make a decision to listen and understand the messages of the speaker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There is some multitasking work here. Try to focus on listening to the speaker first, then on preparing your answer. Don’t comment or bombard the speaker with questions every time there are a few seconds of silence. While listening, ask for a moment to write down your ideas so you don’t forget them and focus back to listening. This will ensure a healthier, more fruitful discussion later on.</p>

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="write"><strong>What about writing?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In today’s electronic age most professional communication is done via the written word.&nbsp; This means that people will form their opinions about you based on it, so it’s essential that your writing skills are on par.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When determining the tone of your writing, think about why you’re writing the document, who are you writing to and what do you want them to understand. Aim for a confident, kind, and sincere overall tone. Ensure that your writing contains nondiscriminatory language, stresses the "you" attitude and the benefit for the reader. Think about who is on the other side of the screen and make sure that it is written at an appropriate level of difficulty.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="talk"><strong>Get up and Talk</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Are you all set talking to computers, engaging in digital conversation and would take that over the dreaded presentation any day? Instead of dreading public speaking and perceiving it as an uncomfortable experience, think of it as an opportunity to share your knowledge and engage with people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Gather your courage, get up — and talk to people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Think about what you want to say, and how important it will be for your audience to know it. How this information can help them in their daily programmer life, (or interaction with it.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="clear"><strong>Make it Clear</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The impact of your communication skills (verbal and written) depends on its clarity. Be concise, but specific. When doing presentations, for example, try to keep just the essential ideas in your slides. It helps both the audience and yourself to focus on the important things.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Choosing your words is especially important when it comes to communicating information to non-techies. As an IT professional, you have a solid reputation for speaking a language that is largely unfamiliar to the general public. Many non-techies don’t have a clue about most of the IT jargon you use.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Like writing code, you want the information you’re presenting to be clear and understandable. Don’t immediately assume your audience has previous knowledge of the topic at hand. What may seem obvious to you may not necessarily be obvious to them. Try to use simple language, and present your knowledge in a way that others understand and benefit from it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Is that clear?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="providefeedback"><strong>Provide Feedback</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Historically, the IT culture is a culture that prioritizes direct communication and provides honest blunt feedback on the work. The Linux Foundation makes it clear “Your code and ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique and criticism.” Make your comments constructive, not corrosive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Inevitably you will get upset about a performed task at work at times. In those moments check your nerves and wait until you’re calm enough to deliver measured feedback. Address the problem, not your frustrations. Be kind yet candid; say what you mean in a tactful yet straightforward way. But don’t sugarcoat it either- remember you have one end goal: to make sure that the issue at hand is promptly resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can achieve a number of things when you give quality feedback. It helps the receiver improve performance, helps motivation,&nbsp; boosts confidence, develops interpersonal skills and understanding, and shows people you value them. Balance giving negative feedback with praise - give positive feedback to your team members when they are performing well. This will increase their confidence to keep up at that level of performance and encourage them to do even better.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Offering kudos to your colleagues for a job well done is an excellent way to boost morale and reinforce positive behavior<em>. </em>A good team player is capable of giving both praise and constructive criticism.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="receivefeedback"><strong>Receive Feedback </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A good team player is also capable of receiving feedback. It feels nice to be recognized by your peers, doesn’t it? Certainly. Positive feedback undoubtedly fuels you to do more, it motivates you to do better. But so does constructive criticism. It helps you improve skills, work product, and interpersonal relationships, paving the way for more positive feedback in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When colleagues share feedback with you, let them share their complete thoughts. Focus on understanding their comments and standpoints. Giving feedback is difficult, thank them to acknowledge their effort. Process the feedback you received, ask questions to get to the root of the issue and think about the possible solution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Constructive criticism gives you important insight for improvement. It is not easy to give and it’s certainly not easy to receive, but with enough time, patience, and planning, you’ll set yourself and your colleagues up for success.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="practice"><strong>Practice, Practice, Practice </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Do you want to improve your interpersonal skills? No magic shortcut here, only practice. Joining a technical meetup? Attending a Soft-Skills Seminar? The more you practice, the better you become.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And it is okay to fail as long as you try. Many programmers are introverted enough to know how difficult it can be to communicate sometimes. They won’t blame you or judge you. (Most of them at least.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Communication is an art, and like any other art form - with a welcoming attitude and enough perseverance - it can be mastered to perfection.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Good communication makes you more open to other people. Boosting your interpersonal skills will get you a significant competitive advantage in just about all aspects of your personal and professional lives. There is always something to learn from someone, no matter the level of expertise you possess. Show interest in the people you meet and you will be surprised by what will come out of it. There will always be a domain in which you can improve.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">These eight tips for improvement will make you a better communicator, team member and (even more) skilled IT professional.

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The opportunity to work remotely is becoming more and more present in companies that do not need their workers to be present at their office desks in order to complete their tasks. Some companies, of course, are not able to give permission for working remotely, due to their need for workers being physically present at their job posts. However, employees who mostly work on their computers can easily get permission to work remotely, from a location that best suits their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With the development of information technology, employees get plenty of advantages in their jobs. For instance, they have opportunities to get their daily activities completed from another location, or from the comfort of their homes. Moreover, employees who are working remotely may be present at all meetings virtually over the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Different companies are beginning to follow this trend and to change alongside with the development of IT technology. Cosmic Development is one of those IT companies that follow the trend of remote working and offer it to their employees in order to make them feel more comfortable while performing their daily work tasks and activities. No matter whether you are a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software developer (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software developer</a>, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="digital marketer (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/digital-marketing-and-sales/" target="_blank">digital marketer</a>, or a <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/administration-and-virtual-assistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="virtual assistant (opens in a new tab)">virtual assistant</a>, feeling enjoyable at work is one of the advantages that come with remote work. Employees can choose a random location in the world, travel and work at the same time, without neglecting the required job activities. And all thanks to the new technologies and the existing option for remote work. However, working remotely can also have negative sides, regardless of the advantages it implies. Read below to discover the pros and cons of working remotely.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="freedom">1. Have Freedom and Flexibility</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the best advantages of working remotely is the opportunity to have freedom and flexibility. Having freedom while completing your job activities means to be able to choose your own working hours. That way, you will be able to choose the most appropriate time of the day to finish the daily tasks. In addition to freedom comes the flexibility of working remotely. Not many employers give their employees the flexibility to work from another location. Employees prefer and choose those companies that offer flexibility as part of their job requirements and perks. Being able to work from a remote location enables workers to organize their time and tasks according to their needs. Employees who have remote jobs can proudly say that they can choose different work locations on a worldwide level for each month thanks to the flexibility that their remote positions entail.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="skills">2. Acquire New Skills</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working remotely is a positive circumstance that helps employees become better workers. Through remote work, employees become more independent workers and develop new skills. Some of those skills are also known as entrepreneurial skills because they encompass organizational and managerial skills. Just like entrepreneurs, remote workers need to know how to organize their time and daily activities, in order to get them finished on time. Without managerial skills, remote workers might get stuck in loads of work due to spending their time on procrastination. Time flies very fast when one is working alone and isolated, without feeling the pressure of work and the office atmosphere.&nbsp;Therefore, remote workers must acquire these new skill sets, if they want to become better at finishing their assignments on time.</p>

<h2 id="money">3. Save Money and Time</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another advantage of working remotely is the ability to save money that otherwise you would spend when going to work at an office. For instance, holding a remote job will help you save money on transport. Traveling each day to an office may result in high transport expenses. Working remotely will save your money for transport and will help you avoid having such high expenses. Moreover, traveling to the office is also a time-consuming activity, especially when there is a big distance between your home and your work office. Remote working can help you save your time on traveling, just like it helps you save your money on transport. Working from home or from a remote location may result in lower expenses and no hours spent on a daily commute.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another aspect of the money-saving advantage of working remotely is the ability to work in comfortable clothes. This implies that you can choose to wear pajamas and sweats while working from a remote location. Wearing such clothes is impossible if you must work at an office. Therefore, working remotely can also help you save money on clothes.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="present">1. Be Physically Present</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the main disadvantages of working remotely is the disability to be physically present at an office in a working environment. A remote position means isolating yourself from other people and sitting alone in front of a computer. This may prove to be good for introverted employees who prefer their own company. However, it is bad when extroverted employees are working remotely and are unable to be present physically at their office. The physical presence gives employees a feeling like they are part of a team and that they belong somewhere. Being isolated when working remotely takes that feeling away from employees and they may feel alone and be avoided by other coworkers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The remote work also prevents employees from being physically present at team meetings at the office. With the development of technology, nowadays employees may be present at meetings through Skype, Slack, etc. However, there is an enormous difference between being physically present at a meeting at the office and being included through online platforms only for several minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="gatherings">2. Miss Social Gatherings</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition to the meetings, working remotely also prevents employees from being physically present at social gatherings organized by the company where they work. A disadvantage of holding a remote job is the disability to be present at social gatherings, such as after-work parties, coworkers' birthday celebrations, holiday celebrations, etc. By missing such events, remote employees may begin feeling socially excluded from their teams, due to the inability to hang out with them outside of working hours. Social exclusion may prove to be a huge problem in long-term employment. Working remotely increases the risk of isolation and internal dissatisfaction due to the failure to be present at social gatherings. The desire to be part of such gatherings may cause the employee to leave the current job, even though there are many pros of working remotely.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="distractions">3. Face Many Distractions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another disadvantage of working remotely is the level of distractions that may occur in a remote location. When working from an office, the working environment does not allow employees to spend too much time on procrastination. Instead, they go to the office and begin working in the same instance. They spend 90 percent of their time on work because the atmosphere in the office subconsciously makes them work more. Working remotely, on the other hand, may prove to be less productive, due to the numerous distractions that may happen in the remote location where you work from. Working from home, for instance, may bring distractions and interruptions from other family members. Moreover, another remote working location may have another set of distractions, such as other employees, conversations, meetings, Internet problems, etc.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The employees are faced with many more pros and cons of remote working, depending on their personal preference for work location. In most cases, remote teams have more benefits from working from another location than working in a regular workplace. Remote workers believe that they are more productive when working in their desired environment. That way they can choose their locations and hold a balance between work and life. Moreover, employees who love traveling for months can work remotely from a different location each month and conquer new horizons while responding to their work assignments on time. Remote workers also save a lot of time which otherwise would have been used on the commute from home to the office. Furthermore, employees who are working remotely and their employers can get additional benefits in their communication skills. Are you a remote worker? If you have more pros or cons of remote working you would like to share, send us a comment.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Attending networking events is one of the investments that professionals can make in order to stimulate their personal development. However, not all individuals think that networking events or conferences will bring them any benefits. Eventually, it all comes down to the willingness and preparedness of individuals to go to such events and spend their money and time for their own professional development. If the attendees do not know what to do at such events, then the conferences or networking events will be a total waste of resources.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Recently, we have published a blog article on <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/conference-and-networking-event-should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Conference and Networking Events</a> and the attendance dilemma that individuals have prior to such occasions. Professionals can either see networking events as a chance for gaining new experiences and connections or as a nightmare due to their indisposition to get out of their comfort zones. Being present at the upcoming Macedonia2025 Summit (13-15 November 2019) in Skopje will provide individuals with the opportunity to expand their personal fields of interest, grow new ideas and boost their creativity. Moreover, the summit may also unlock new business opportunities to professionals who choose to take part in such a networking event.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development is one of the companies that each year sends employees to represent the company at the annual Macedonia2025 Summit.

Last year, one of our colleagues who attended the Summit 2018 - Marija Dimovska - made her personal overview of the panel discussions and sessions.

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you are wondering how challenging it is to be a tech coordinator at a fast-growing IT support services company such as Cosmic Development, it is time to get to know Atanas Arizanov and learn more about his scope of work, expertise and the way he overcomes the challenges he faces on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Atanas is a software engineer, PHP developer and tech coordinator, who has been with us for more than eight years. He has started his Cosmic career as a PHP developer. At first, he was in charge of building and implementing web solutions for various clients, but thanks to the dedication and professionalism towards work, Atanas soon became Cosmic Development's Internship Coordinator and guided many young professionals who were eager to upgrade their knowledge and experience through the hands-on training at our company. His incredible talent for working with people naturally led him to the next stage of his career - becoming our appointed Technology Coordinator.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What is the role of Tech Coordinator? Tell us more about your range of duties at Cosmic Development.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The responsibilities of a Tech Coordinator include acting as the link between end-users of a website and the high-level support, while at the same time providing technical support and advice on the most convenient IT choices. Apart from this, the Tech Coordinator of an IT company must not only know how to install and configure both hardware and software but also control the system and network performance. This role requires performing troubleshooting, maintenance activities, data restoration, and repairs. And finally, a Tech Coordinator must also possess excellent communication and people skills in order to solve problems on the spot and to be able to collaborate with other IT pros.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My job responsibilities as a tech coordinator include managing multiple projects, but most of all require regular and consistent communication with internal teams in the company. By this, I mean having weekly meetings with a group of team leads and discussing all the projects included in that group for existing, potential problems and issues, but also the team achievements, their success, and happiness.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What are the 3 top challenges you face as the Tech Coordinator, and how do you overcome them?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Race with time</strong> :) I'd say that's the number one challenge for most tech coordinators in our industry. This role requires a lot of time and tons of energy to oversee all of the activities and keep everything under control in this fast-paced, ever-changing "game" of new technologies and innovations.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">That leads to the next big test for every tech coordinator - <strong>staying calm </strong>no matter what. We are all only people, capable of great things but prone to mistakes. Sometimes it's not our day, but we have to do everything we can to control ourselves and not to allow our own frustrations and bad inner energy to pass to our co-workers and influence their workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Last but not least: <strong>good organization</strong>. Every tech coordinator has to know how to organize their day really well. From time to time, the meetings may overlap as well as the tasks, so one has to make an excellent daily strategy to deliver daily tasks and achieve objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I've been embracing those (and other) challenges for the last five years, and I can only hope that one day I will be able to say that I have mastered them all. :)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What is the most valuable thing you've learned working as the Tech Coordinator?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I've learned many valuable lessons since I took the role of the tech coordinator, but if I have to name only one, it would be this - Never make decisions by yourself. Even when you are sure that you are right about something, always consult with your co-workers and team-mates, ask them for their opinion and advice, and truly listen to what they have to say before you make your move. You know what they say: more eyes see better than a pair and more minds think better than just one.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How do you boost your productivity?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Coffee. Always coffee. Actually, several cups of coffee daily :D Of course, there are other practical (and perhaps healthier) ways to stay up in the game, like good daily organization and efficient team coordination. Furthermore, open communication with people involved in the projects for which I am responsible is also the key to success. Utilize this advice to boost your productivity and you will be able to accomplish anything.</p>

<h2><strong>You've started at Cosmic Development as a PHP developer and worked your way to a more complex role. What was your primary drive for professional and personal development?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Regardless of your current role, improving yourself and getting better at what you do for a living is vital if you want to advance in your career. I would say that my strongest motive is the desire to learn new things and grow my knowledge and skills. The best way to increase your professional and personal qualities is through hard work and aspiration for achieving a better version of yourself. Moreover, the constant will to improve and reach a higher level both as a human being and as a professional in the IT industry is what keeps me moving forward, one step at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What is the most valuable advice you have to offer to your younger colleagues?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At the risk of sounding cliché, I'd say that the most important advice I have to offer to my co-workers is a straightforward one: always work hard, follow your dreams, stay in touch with yourself and do what makes you happy. If coding makes you happy - go for it. In case you feel you are the proper fit for the company you work for - revel in it. If you think that you are a valuable asset for the team - commit yourself to it. Do whatever it takes to upgrade yourself and constantly keep pushing forward. Prepare for the hard times as well, because after all, where's the challenge if things are too easy?&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What do you like the most about your current role? What are you working on currently?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I genuinely enjoy having a job that I find meaningful and engaging, and which makes me fulfilled. The role of a tech coordinator gives me exactly that feeling of inner satisfaction and that is what I love about my job. Currently, I work on several projects that keep me occupied and engaged. One of the biggest perks of my job is the freedom to provide ideas and solutions for a range of different problems and help my colleagues on a daily basis. Another, less exciting but equally important part of my job is project planning, scheduling meetings, managing teams, developing and implementing deliverables, monitoring, and reporting.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Besides being an incredible professional, Atanas is also a caring husband and devoted father to their only child, and a massive fan of hard rock and metal music. How do you manage to balance between the technology coordinator position and the role of a father now?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The work experience that I have gained over the years as a tech coordinator helps me do things way faster than I used to do. Thanks to the direct and open relationship with the clients, it's easy for me to communicate and be honest with them and their requirements. The role of a father made my life more fulfilling and happier, but it also encouraged me to learn to balance things, to enjoy the smallest of things, and appreciate the time I get to spend with my family. Balancing my job position and the role of a father is something that you learn on the way. And while doing so, you realize that both of these things require good organization and communication skills and a sense of knowing when is the right time to do something.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If I have to choose only one, it would definitely be the superpower of <strong>teleportation</strong>. Traveling to far-off places without physically crossing the space between would be ideal for me. Teleportation will enable me to do multiple things in multiple places, and see things from a different perspective. Teleportation will contribute to global transportation and people will be able to enjoy the world without borders.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is probably the toughest question of them all !!! :D I have a couple of favorite bands which I love and respect a lot. But if I have to choose one out of my list of favorites, then I have to say that my most favorite band is Amorphis. I have attended many of their concerts over the last few years and each of them is a story for itself and has its own beauty. Amorphis’s last concert in Sofia is what left me impressed and astounded. It was an amazing one!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Team building is a term that encompasses a wide range of activities that improve social relations between employees at a company. Companies usually organize team buildings at a remote location, so that employees get to mingle outside of the office environment. In most cases, employees are divided into several teams for the purposes of the team building. Each team has to complete certain tasks that involve the usage of their brains while behaving as a unit in order to resolve those tasks. Our company is one of the organizations that implement team building activities as a way to improve group development as a whole and employees' personal skills as individuals. The main purpose of the team building is to involve employees in different activities and to make them feel appreciated as team members. That way, they would start building trust within the team while resolving the tasks at hand, even though they do not usually work together as a group at the office. Therefore, regardless of whether we work as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software developers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software developers</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="digital marketing specialists (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/digital-marketing-and-sales/" target="_blank">digital marketing specialists</a>, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="virtual assistants (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/administration-and-virtual-assistance/" target="_blank">virtual assistants</a>, we all got to spend time together and improve our social relations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development organizes annual team buildings for our employees thus enabling them to work on and improve their communication and social skills within the company. This year’s annual team building happened over the last weekend, from 15th to 17th November 2019 in Mavrovo - a skiing center in Macedonia, with a national park and lake. Mavrovo abounds with beautiful mountains, perfect scenic landscapes, and fresh air. Our employees were accommodated at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Hotel Bistra (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.bistra.com/" target="_blank">Hotel Bistra</a>, one of the hotels that are part of the Resort Mavrovo Recreation Department. It is the perfect location for team building activities and quality time spent with your coworkers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our employees from Toronto (Canada), Belgrade (Serbia), Skopje and Bitola (Macedonia), and Lome (Togo) came together in Mavrovo and got a chance to mingle with each other. They were divided into nine teams, each of which was carrying the name of one planet from our solar system. Therefore, we had the following nine teams: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. If you want to know how we spent the team-building weekend at Mavrovo and which activities kept us occupied, read about some of them below:</p>

<h2 id="mindgames"><strong>Mind Games</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Mind games are mental exercises created for the purpose of improving the function of the brain. Moreover, mind games are included in team building activities with an intention to not only help team members identify problems within the team, but also to recognize the advantages and good qualities of each individual team member. These games also help team members come together as one entity and find solutions to various brain teasers and puzzles. Through critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork, team members can successfully resolve these mind games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our Cosmic employees had the opportunity to play several mind games as part of the activities for this year’s team building. The nine teams were further divided into two smaller groups, and half of the team members had to use special communication skills in order to explain the other half of the team what they were supposed to do. For instance, one half of the team had to draw an image with various shapes after reading written instructions about how to draw it from the other half of the team. In the meantime, the other half of the team followed written instructions for crafting a crossbow out of several pens and rubber bands. These mind games were the best brain teasers and ice breakers to begin the team building weekend with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="adventuregames"><strong>Adventure Games</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This year’s team building schedule included adventure games as part of the expected group activities. Adventure games are activities that challenge individuals to use both their minds and their strength at the same time. These games contributed to the personal enjoyment of each team member. Moreover, the activities made employees feel like they belong in a group of people and helped them establish new friendships. The adventure games, just like the mind games, were coordinated by people from the Resort Mavrovo Recreation Department whose main purpose was to provide us with a little excitement and help us create memories that will stay with us forever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Adventure games are not extreme sports activities and do not require participants to be athletes or in great physical condition in order to participate. In other words, participants must be mentally prepared to participate in adventure games and to know how to use communication and organization skills. Therefore, these games can easily be called adventure recreation or adventure training games, because players need to only have the will to take part in a game which mandates the usage of both brains and speed at the same time. See the photos to get a better idea of what kind of adventure games our employees got to participate in. </p>

<h2 id="lunch"><strong>Traditional Lunch at the Old Goat House&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After long hours of playing adventure games, the nine teams got on one of the many ski lifts of Mavrovo and took a hiking tour to the top of the mountain Bistra. As a nice finish to the hike, the employees had an organized lunch at the Old Goat House (“Staro Bachilo”) with traditional Macedonian food. The place offered traditional Macedonian cheese pie with sour milk as a side dish and different kinds of grilled meat. Our foreign colleagues got the chance to try the Macedonian cuisine and they loved it. Furthermore, the ambient of the Old Goat House contributed to the atmosphere, because it showed a display of different kinds of stuffed animals, and a display of animals’ heads, such as bears, goats, squirrels, deer, birds of prey, etc.</p>

<h2 id="mavrovision"><strong>Mavrovision</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The final activity of the team building was called “Mavrovision” - a word comprised of “Mavrovo” and “Eurovision”. To those of you who do not live in Europe and do not know what Eurovision is, it is an annual international song contest with participants presenting European countries mainly. Similarly to this, we held Mavrovision - a karaoke song contest with participants representing the planets in our solar system. Each of the nine teams had to select a song of their choice and sing it in front of the other teams. In the end, the nine teams voted and selected the winner of Mavrovision by giving them from one to 12 points, following the example of the Eurovision’s voting system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apart from the karaoke song contest, Mavrovision consisted of another segment: recitation. Each team received a piece of paper with the lyrics of either a Serbian or a Bulgarian song. Team members had to recite the songs in a dramatic manner in front of everyone. This was especially interesting because our foreign colleagues tried to read the lyrics of the songs in Serbian or Bulgarian language, which is not common for them. The other eight teams also voted for the best recital and gave points to their competition, just like with the song contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">All of these activities only contributed to getting our employees to feel closer to each other, regardless of the location where they work from. The team-building weekend spent away in Mavrovo helped us achieve a mutual feeling of comfortability and ease between ourselves, which is similar to that feeling of a family. And that is exactly what we are - a family! And now, although the team building is over, we are already looking forward to the next one in 2020.&nbsp;Till then, best regards from our Cosmic family in Mavrovo!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Programming books are a source of useful information that developers can use if they want to enrich their personal knowledge and work skills. Therefore, the action of reading programming books has been always a subject of discussion between individuals who disagree on whether books are really that important. Half of the programmers think that they can get the mandatory knowledge for web, app, or <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software development (opens in a new tab)">software development</a> through good practice and even better knowledge of the Internet. However, the other half of the programmers believe that it is necessary to read programming books if developers want to improve their knowledge and skills.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Programming books are an essential part of the personal development and knowledge of individuals who want to advance in their fields of expertise. Knowing how to find a solution to a coding problem online is a very important skill when working on big projects, however, reading books for programming may also prove to be beneficial on a long-term basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although the list of best programming books may vary based on personal preference, there are some books that are on the programmers' "must-read" list. Developers need to start reading books in addition to the articles they read online if they want to call themselves professionals. Currently, the most popular “know-how” sources among software developers are the following five programming books:</p>

<h2 id="pragmatic"><strong><em>The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery</em> by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">“The Pragmatic Programmer” is one of those programming books that provide developers with fresh comprehension of coding and the ability to create better software. Regardless of whether programmers have experience or are beginners, this book will improve their personal productivity and job satisfaction. David Thomas and Andrew Hunt wrote the first edition of this book in 1999 with the intention to help programmers examine the core of software development, regardless of the programming language. Back in those days, this book helped in the development of a Pragmatic philosophy which produced a large number of books, audiobooks, screencasts, and success stories.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The same book from 20 years ago re-examines the modern programming principles in the newest edition that came out in September 2019. This new edition of “The Pragmatic Programmer” tackles various topics interesting for modern programmers, such as personal responsibility, career development, architectural techniques for preserving the code’s flexibility, etc. In addition, reading this book will help programmers learn how to resolve potential problems with code, how to write adaptable and dynamic code, and how to guard against security exposure. Moreover, developers will discover how to implement the Pragmatic Starter Kit and build teams of Pragmatic Programmers. They will also know how to take responsibility for their careers by avoiding programming by coincidence and facing duplicate knowledge. Developers will learn all of these skills and will develop new habits that will guarantee success in their careers.</p>

<h2 id="cleancode"><strong><em>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</em> by Robert C. Martin</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">“Clean Code” is one of the three most important Robert C. Martin’s books for programming. The “Clean Code” book will help developers to write better code, to discover how to convert bad into good code, and to become better programmers. Robert C. Martin decided to write this book as a challenge to programmers to reassess their professional values and their work commitment. The “Clean Code” challenges developers to read lots of code and to think about what is right or what is wrong with the code in front of them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The “Clean Code” book is a must-read programming book for all developers, software engineers, and project leaders who want to produce better code. Programmers who decide to read this book will enrich their knowledge of coding and will be able to differentiate good from bad code. Moreover, they will learn how to format code and get maximum readability, as well as how to create good names, classes, functions in order to transform bad code into a good one. Furthermore, programmers will discover how to handle errors without covering the code logic, and how to practice test-driven development.</p>

<h2 id="cleancoder"><strong><em>The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</em> by Robert C. Martin</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">“The Clean Coder” is one of the programming books that Robert C. Martin wrote for improving software craftsmanship. Developers are encouraged to read this book if they want to get practical advice about coding and creating software. Martin published “The Clean Coder” in 2011 and expected readers to learn that programming is not only a simple technique, but it is also an attitude. The book teaches programmers how their self-respect must be high if they plan to approach software development and face difficult problems that require appropriate decisions. Therefore, programmers who are professionals in their work must treat the practice of creating a software as a craft.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When reading “The Clean Coder”, readers will be able to learn what it is to be a true software craftsman and how to become one. This book will mainly teach programmers how to deal with conflicts, managers, and tight schedules, as well as how to avoid burnout and pressure from the big loads of work. It will also help developers learn how to deal with the so-called “writer’s block” and how to manage their time for a certain task. Therefore, “The Clean Coder” is a programming book that both beginners and experienced developers need to read if they want to become professionals in their jobs. </p>

<h2 id="cleanarchitecture"><strong><em>Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design</em> by Robert C. Martin</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">“Clean Architecture” is another of Martin’s books for programming, which discusses software architecture and its ability to help with the improvement of the developer’s productivity. Robert C. Martin wrote the “Clean Architecture” as an addition to the “Clean Code” and “The Clean Coder”, revealing the rules of software and helping programmers apply those rules in their work. Developers can learn which choices are critical for their success and which challenges they will have to make in order to finish their projects. “Clean Architecture” is one of those programming books that will come in handy to all software architects and managers, as well as to all system analysts and designers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Programming books may be useful not only for programming as a process but also for learning the software structure and design. “Clean Architecture” does exactly that. It teaches software architects what they need to achieve and which are the best practices and core disciplines for achieving the aim. Moreover, the book shows how programming paradigms restrict the developers’ tasks and impose discipline. It also helps developers to distinguish what is truly important and what is not, while discovering how to prevent failures in designs and architectures. Finally, “Clean Architecture” teaches programmers how to implement web structures, databases, console, and other embedded applications. Therefore, developers need to read this book if they want to master essential software design principles. </p>

<h2 id="agileprinciples"><strong><em>Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</em> by Robert C. Martin</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The final choice from our Top 5 programming books is the award-winning book “Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#” that Robert C. Martin wrote in order to familiarize programmers with the Agile principles. This guide for Agile methods is especially useful to Java and C++ programmers because it illustrates the Agile fundamentals and moves from UML models to C# code. Developers who wonder which programming books contain the necessary knowledge of C#, Java and Agile software need to pay closer attention to this book. C# programmers, software development managers, and business analysts will get sufficient knowledge of Agile software and how to apply it in the .NET Framework.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The “Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#” displays the basics of the Agile movement as well as many source code examples proven in practice. Programmers who decide to read this book will learn the Agile designs and principles as well as 14 practices of Extreme Programming. They will also get familiar with five types of UML diagrams and will know how to use them. In addition to this, after reading this book, developers will be able to use all that knowledge in a real-world project through pair programming and designing.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Google Analytics Academy provides an opportunity to learn Google’s online measurement tools for free in order to help organizations grow their businesses. Ever since I became an SEO Content Strategist for Cosmic Development, I got interested in how the website content I wrote ranks on Google and who comprises the audience that reads both the website content and the blog articles. Therefore, I decided to learn how to utilize Google Analytics for the company’s benefit and to discover how to collect and analyze intelligence data. After a short research, I discovered that the Google Analytics Academy offers six free online courses about every one of Google’s measurement tools. I decided to complete one course per month and to implement the knowledge that I gain in the SEO content strategy for Cosmic’s <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">website</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="blog (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>. If you continue reading the article below, you will discover my personal experience with the following six courses and the benefits that each of them offers:</p>

<h2 id="beginner"><strong>Course 1: Google Analytics for Beginners</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first free online course of the Google Analytics Academy discusses basic features and it is known as the <em>Google Analytics for Beginners</em>. This course taught me the fundamentals of Google Analytics and led me into the world that now is part of my everyday tasks. At first, it showed me how to create and set up my Google Analytics account, as well as how to navigate through its interface. The course gave me the opportunity to learn through practical examples both overview and full reports in order to understand and implement the knowledge in my work. It also defined the Audience, Acquisition and Behavior reports, thus guiding me through the process of campaign and conversion tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After completing the <em>Google Analytics for Beginners</em> course, I was able to use the basic features of Google Analytics on my own and to create and understand its reports. This course also prepared me for measuring custom campaigns and Google Ads campaigns. I became capable of conducting reports and campaigns on my own, for the purposes of performing my daily tasks and job responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="advanced"><strong>Course 2: Advanced Google Analytics</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After acquiring the basic Analytics knowledge, Google Analytics Academy left me with a hunger for learning more features, collecting more data, and creating reports. That is why I could not wait to begin with the second course: <em>Advanced Google Analytics</em>. This advanced course guides learners through the Google Analytics configurations that track, collect and process data beneficial for their businesses. Following this course enables learners to become familiar with how to categorize the data according to users and sessions, and how to create a measurement plan.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After completing the <em>Advanced Google Analytics</em> course, I was able to create new custom metrics and custom dimensions, and also to understand already-set custom metrics and dimensions. Moreover, I acquired the required skills for conducting data analysis according to a channel, or according to an audience. This course also tackled a set of additional advanced marketing tools that are useful to the business. Those tools are beneficial for remarketing strategies as well as for targeting the audience with dynamic remarketing.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Having completed both the beginners and the advanced course of the Google Analytics Academy, I was ready to broaden my knowledge to a level of a power user. The <em>Google Analytics for Power Users</em> is a course that has the main purpose to teach learners how to measure the website traffic and to see which users will convert or not.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I finished the course <em>Google Analytics for Power Users</em>, I was able to analyze the website users and to compare the users who converted with those who did not convert. I also gained more confidence in analyzing various traffic sources and discovering which of them brings the most value to the website. Besides, I was also able to customize channels and improve e-commerce performance. And last but not least, I used the knowledge that I gained from this course on identifying which content from the website showed top-performing metrics. Analyzing the content helped me a lot with the SEO content strategy for the website and its blog. I also learned how to improve the website content according to the analysis made with Google Analytics. This course helped me especially in my work and I discovered the path that our readers take from the moment they enter our website until they exit it. </p>

<h2 id="360"><strong>Course 4: Getting Started with Google Analytics 360</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With the fourth course <em>Getting Started with Google Analytics 360</em>, I discovered that Analytics 360 is the enterprise version of Google Analytics. Analytics 360 is part of the Google marketing platform that connects Google’s enterprise advertising and marketing products. That way, Google Analytics 360 helps marketers plan, buy, measure, and optimize digital media and customer experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This course introduced me to powerful and advanced features that are not available on the standard Google Analytics product, such as roll-up reporting, custom funnels, unsampled reports, and custom tables. In addition, I got familiar with BigQuery reporting and its benefits, as well as with the products of Google Marketing Platform integrations and Google Ad Manager. Furthermore, I was able to learn the Campaign Manager integration and how to use CM reports, dimensions, and metrics. The same thing applies to the Display and Video 360 integration and to the Google Ads 360 integration. What is most important is that I was able to experience real-world examples in order to understand how to use the Google Analytics 360 features and integrations for the purposes of achieving the business goals. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The <em>Introduction to Data Studio</em> is one of the two final courses of the Google Analytics Academy that do not delve into Google Analytics any further. Instead, both courses instigate the Google Analytics features and teach marketers how to visualize data online so that they can gain better insights into their business performance. Data Studio is a free data visualization tool that lets you illustrate your data in powerful reports. This introductory course into Data Studio helps in collecting and connecting data, creating reports, and collaborating with other coworkers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Data Studio is the tool that changed the way I completed my daily work tasks and which made my job easier. Namely, while following the Google Analytics Academy courses, I was creating monthly and weekly reports for the performance of the website and blog I was working on. However, when I completed the <em>Introduction to Data Studio</em> course, I was overwhelmed with the opportunities and benefits it offered for creating such reports. Data Studio, as a free data visualization tool, let me collect data and illustrate it in powerful reports. After learning how to use it, I began creating performance reports for the website and blog I am working on. I just linked the company’s Google Analytics account with Data Studio and the data was automatically transferred. Since then, I have been creating both monthly and weekly reports without spending too much time analyzing with Google Analytics. I just make sure to change the dates according to the period that I want to analyze, and Data Studio shows me everything I need in order to decipher the website and blog performance.</p>

<h2 id="tagmanager"><strong>Course 6: Google Tag Manager Fundamentals</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Google Tag Manager Fundamentals</em> is the final course of all six free online courses of the Google Analytics Academy. This final course shows learners how to easily implement and update multiple analytics and marketing tags for a website. The course guides learners through the basics of Tag Manager, which includes developing a measurement plan and a tag management strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Thanks to the <em>Google Tag Manager Fundamentals</em> course, I learned how to create website tags and triggers, how to transfer valuable information from a website into Google Analytics, and how to use Tag Manager in order to easily manage both marketing and remarketing efforts. This course helped me understand how to use Tag Manager not only for desktop but also for mobile phones. Moreover, I discovered how to manage multiple analytics and marketing tags, and how to prevent redundant and incorrect tags from reducing the website performance and distorting data measurement.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keeping a work-life balance is very important to employees if they want to maintain a healthy lifestyle on a long-term basis. Software developers often get overwhelmed with work and are unable to strictly divide their work from their personal lives. This only contributes to failing to maintain a work-life balance. It is common knowledge that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software development (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software development</a> is not an easy job. Developers can often get stuck in loads of work or spend hours on resolving some mistakes in the code. In such situations, they easily lose track of time and can prolong their working hours, thus shortening their personal life moments. That is why they need to keep a work-life balance that will separate their careers from their personal lives. If you are a web developer who faces a constant struggle in dividing these two things, then you must read the following guide to work-life balance:</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="overall"><strong>Lead an Overall Balanced Life</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software developers often strive to lead two separate lives - work life and personal life. The work-life span consists of hours spent working, while the personal life is contained by all activities that happen outside of work. Separating life into two parts will only cause a feeling of leading two different lives. Developers are not encouraged to do so if they want to keep a work-life balance. Therefore, they can begin by understanding that both their work and personal life go together. They need to learn how to combine them and to get the best of both worlds. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Programmers who manage to have a balanced life in all aspects will not feel the pressure of leading two individual lives. Employees often feel dissatisfied with their jobs or not entirely happy in their working environment. Part of that dissatisfaction is due to the fact that they separate the work experience from their actual lives. If they accept the work as part of their actual lives, they will feel better and will eventually achieve an overall balanced life.</p>

<h2 id="overtime"><strong>Stop Working Overtime</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When web developers plan their strategy for leading a balanced life, they need to pay attention to the working hours. Programmers most often spend enormous amounts of time at their offices or in front of their computers. They believe that devoting many hours to their job and working overtime will help them advance in their careers. Although working too much may help programmers in progressing with their professional development, it may also reduce the quality of their lives. Programmers need to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="break their daily routine (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-software-developers-break-their-daily-work-routine/" target="_blank">break their daily routine</a> and use regular breaks in their work so that they can face the obstacles that their daily tasks impose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working overtime only lengthens the working hours spent in an office on a daily basis, thus decreasing the number of hours that they dedicate to personal life. Therefore, software developers are encouraged to work 40 hours per week and nothing above that. The only occasion when they are allowed to make an exception is in case of an emergency. Following this rule will help developers to obtain an overall work-life balance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="priorities"><strong>Organize the List of Priorities</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When trying to accomplish a work-life balance, web developers need to take control of their lives and disallow their work to consume all of their time. To do so, they need to make themselves a priority and dedicate more time spent on their personal lives. Many employees get up in the morning with the thought of going to the office and getting the work done immediately, after which they give themselves the freedom of utilizing their leftover time for personal purposes. This is a good practice for using the working time efficiently, however, it is not that beneficial on a long-term basis. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Employees need to avoid making their job a priority over their personal lives. They should direct their focus on themselves as much as they do on their jobs. They need to strive to make themselves a priority and to dedicate more time to themselves. For instance, work does not always have to come first. Employees can get up earlier in the morning and dedicate a few hours to themselves before going to work. This will not only change their list of priorities, but it will lead them towards the desired work-life balance. However, this does not mean that developers should neglect their jobs due to dedicating more time to their personal lives. They just need to learn when and what to prioritize.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="relationships"><strong>Pick the Right Relationships</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software developers, just like any other employees, are struggling with keeping their life-work balance due to the great number of relationships they want to preserve. Even though having many friends and maintaining healthy relationships with them may seem like a good thing, picking fewer friendships may turn out to be better in the end. Maintaining a work-life balance includes picking the most valuable relationships and nurturing them while getting rid of people whose friendship leads nowhere. This will not only save valuable time but it will also improve the overall quality of life. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Choosing wisely the list of connections and relationships may also help developers advance in their careers and gain control over their life. Hanging with the right people may also improve the work-life balance through the improvement of the non-working life. This can be also done by aligning the professional and personal life with carefully picked relationships. The right friends may also help programmers in developing their personal <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="soft skills (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-soft-skills-for-software-developers/" target="_blank">soft skills</a>, which are big assets for their career progress.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="presentmoment"><strong>Live in the Present Moment</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Employees usually cannot keep a work-life balance due to the thought of the future and they forget to live in the present moment. Developers, like other employees, most often find themselves spending hours from work and life on making future plans. Thus, they forget that life is happening now at the moment and that they should grasp any second of today, instead of waiting for tomorrow to come. However, they do not need to just enjoy the current moment and have no responsibility whatsoever, but they need to enjoy life as well. That is why keeping a life-work balance means that employees need to enjoy every moment of their lives, regardless of whether they spend it at work or with friends and family.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>When did your Cosmic journey start? How would you describe it so far? Could you tell us how it all started?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It all started back in 2012. At that time, Cosmic Development was the first IT company in Macedonia that tried to replicate Google’s office environment. I saw their job advertisement for PHP developers, and I applied immediately. And here I am - still working in the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software development (opens in a new tab)">software development</a> department in the same company. My Cosmic journey had its ups and downs like in every other business. However, I can say that I made the right choice for joining Cosmic and I plan to keep going for more.</p>

<h2><strong>What is your role in Cosmic Development now? Tell us more about your range of duties.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For the last 5+ years, I have been working on a project called Bookmark, which is a website creation tool for non-technical people. As the CTO of Bookmark, I am responsible for managing the development team as well as for creating timelines and deployments on all technological services. Furthermore, I am acting as a mentor to the team members and making sure that all technology practices adhere to regulatory standards.</p>

<h2><strong>What are the challenges you face as the CTO of Bookmark.com, and how do you overcome them?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The IT industry is a dynamic one, where any updates in the technology can bring significant changes. My primary responsibility is to ensure that the company is in a good position with the technology that we use and to make sure that we deliver the best results for our clients. However, when having such a responsibility, you are also facing a lot of challenges. Some of the main challenges as a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) are the following:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Identification of the right approach&nbsp;</li><li>Performance optimization</li><li>Security for the organization</li><li>Recruitment of the best talent</li><li>Technical vision and roadmap</li><li>Organizational structure for tech teams</li><li>Product management</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When facing so many challenges, I can only say that there is no clear pattern to deal with all of them. You need to be proactive, adapt to the current state of the market, always try to evolve your knowledge, do a lot of networking, etc.</p>

<h2><strong>What is the most valuable thing you've learned working as a CTO?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When working, you learn new things on a daily basis. That way, I have been evolving not only as an individual but also as a CTO of Bookmark. One of the things that I have learned in these years is that you must know how to predict things easily. You need to see your team’s limits and constraints. Moreover, you need to know how to balance delivery time and technical debt. And also you should always be present and helpful to your team. You must try to find time to speak with your team members and be able to listen and give them useful advice.</p>

<h2><strong>It sounds like you genuinely love what you do! When did you discover your passion for programming?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I got my first personal computer when I was only nine years old. From that period, my love for computers began to expand more and more. I loved not only the computer as a machine but also the video games that I played on it. However, my passion for programming awoke at a later age. In high school, we had IT lessons, which taught me the basic knowledge of computers and computer science itself. I believe that at that moment I developed a passion for programming.</p>

<h2><strong>You've started at Cosmic Development as a PHP developer and worked your way to a more complex role. What was your primary drive for professional and personal development?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My primary drive for professional and personal development consisted of getting a good education, observation, and mentorship that can help me improve my skills and later to enhance the employees in the workplace. My idea was to deepen my knowledge in a specific area in which I like to evolve. Moreover, I wanted to gain freedom and to be able to work whenever and wherever I want, while also increasing your earning potential.</p>

<h2><strong>What is the most valuable advice you have to offer to your younger colleagues?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As engineers, our job is not just to solve problems - that’s doable. Our main job task is to simplify the issues. When trying to simplify a complicated problem, we make sure to understand it in a better way. But more important is the fact that when simplifying the problem, we learn how to maintain it easily for a more extended period. When delivering simple solutions to those problems, we use a better decision-making process, and it leads us to a more simple and more well-organized codebase. That, consequently, leads to better execution and development of more stable software.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How stressful is your job and how do you overcome nerve-racking situations in general?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working can sometimes be stressful, for sure. However, being organized and coordinated with other coworkers can prove to be beneficial. That is the main reason why I always tend to keep myself organized. Since I am a morning person, the first thing I do in the morning is reading and responding to emails. After that, I discuss with my teammates the schedule for that day, and I assign the tickets. Remember: Balance is everything in life.</p>

<h2><strong>What is your greatest achievement outside of work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I can say without a doubt that my greatest achievement outside of work is becoming a dad :) I am proud to say that 15 months ago, I became a father to the most beautiful baby girl who is my inspiration and who brings joy in everything I do.</p>

<h2><strong>And finally, what do you like to do for fun?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have a passion for motorcycles! Almost half of my life, I owned many different types of motorcycles. Everyone who knows me can confirm that I love riding motorbikes. However, I have other hobbies as well. Apart from riding motorcycles, I like to play football and to go skiing in the winter.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">New Year celebrations are already all around us. As the old year approaches its end and the new one is about to begin, the magical euphoria emerges in all its glory. People begin with the pre-new year celebrations one month before the long-awaited remarkable night. During the entire month of December, people prepare for the holidays and spend each moment in jubilation for the arrival of the new year. Furthermore, this trend of celebrating the new year before the night itself is also present among many companies and organizations. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Companies all around the world manage to get together all employees and throw them a pre-new year celebration. In a like manner, Cosmic Development as an <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">IT support services company</a> also organizes a set of new year celebrations in all of their locations. The Cosmic celebrations do not consist of only partying at a club or having dinner at a restaurant. Instead, employees in all locations have several activities both at the offices and outside of them, thus celebrating the coming of the new year. Read more about those new year celebrations and activities in the article below.</p>

<h2><strong>Secret Santa</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In almost all companies, Secret Santa is a pre-new year celebration event where colleagues exchange Christmas gifts anonymously. In other words, each employee buys a gift for a coworker and puts it under the office Christmas tree. The gifts do not have to be too expensive and the price for them is usually set around a predetermined sum. The employees have a week’s time to purchase a gift and bring it to the office. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After all of the gifts are placed under the Christmas tree, coworkers gather around and the unwrapping of the presents begins. In the end, coworkers may guess who their Secret Santa is, or it may remain a mystery, depending on the decision of the one who gives the present. The several Cosmic Development locations throughout the world organize their own Secret Santa event. It is an opportunity to hang out with coworkers and enjoy the merriest of holidays.</p>

<h2><strong>Kids Christmas</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the Cosmic Development’s New Year celebrations is the Kids Christmas event. This event is also organized in all of the Cosmic Development locations. Each year, Cosmic prepares Christmas packets for each child of every employee in the company. We love not only our employees but their children as well. That is why we cannot celebrate the New Year without giving our love and care to the Cosmic children. Therefore, we organize a Kids Christmas event with our own Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus. The employees bring their children to the office for a present giveaway and a photoshoot with Santa Claus and his lady. The children spend a few hours at the office with Santa Claus unwrapping their presents while enjoying the snacks and drinks prepared especially for them. See below some of the photos of this event at the various Cosmic Development offices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Pre-New Year’s Eve&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apart from the new year celebrations at the office, Cosmic Development also organizes an informal pre-new year’s eve party. Namely, each Cosmic location chooses their own way of celebrating the new year’s arrival: either eating dinner at a restaurant or partying at a night club. This long-awaited New Year celebration takes place a week or two before the actual New Year’s Eve. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This year, Cosmic Development organized pre-new year celebration parties in all locations: Belgrade, Bitola, Skopje, and Toronto. This is one of those occasions when coworkers get to hang out outside of the office, have a conversation that is not connected with work and spend quality time with all colleagues. The New Year Celebration brings employees closer together and increases the level of friendliness and team spirit in the company. To get a glance of the atmosphere, take a look at the photos below or visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/cosmicdevelopment/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=2559196074128227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Facebook page</a> to see more photos.</p>

<h2><strong>New Year Charity Events</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apart from the numerous New Year celebrations that Cosmic Development organizes, we also help out charity events during the holidays. Our company organizes several such events throughout the entire year. However, there is no better time to be generous than the holiday season. That is why our employees from all locations take part in charity events for children coming from poor families and provide each child with a Christmas packet. Some of these children have never gotten a Christmas packet in their life. That is why Cosmic employees participate in this kind of charity event and make those children feel the positive energy of the new year celebration. By making such donations, our employees get the chance to put a smile on the children’s faces, even if it is only just for a while.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This was just a glimpse of our New Year celebrations for this year. We can hardly wait to see how we will celebrate next year. Till then, we send joyful wishes to all of you and may you have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The best blog posts do not happen overnight. In order to write a good blog post, the writer needs to know the target location and audience, but also to know which blog posts will be read and which not. That is why at the end of the year the editor must make a review of the best blog posts from that year and see which topics performed the best. A blogging review is a perfect way to summarize the work that is done throughout the year when the year approaches its end. Although our blog is quite new and was released in July 2019, we only get to make a review of the best blog posts in the past six months. Nevertheless, here are the top 5 most-read and best blog posts, the top 3 most-read interviews with our employees, and the most-read interview with one of our clients.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">When creating a digital marketing strategy, companies need to pay close attention to world trends, technologies, and techniques. However, it is not easy just to read about upcoming <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="digital marketing trends (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/5-digital-marketing-trends-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank">digital marketing trends</a> or follow a list of best practices and make a successful strategy. Companies need to think outside of the box and learn how to take advantage of the newest trends that will turn out beneficial for their businesses. Marketing managers need to know that every business is different and that digital marketing strategies must be unique for each company. Therefore, the company’s digital marketing goals must always be aligned with the company’s overall goals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Following the world trends in the digital marketing strategy is beneficial for each company that wants to be one step ahead of its competition. Technology improves on a daily basis and companies need to follow the latest trends in the world of digital marketing if they do not want to fall behind. A successful <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/digital-marketing-and-sales/">digital marketing</a> strategy for 2020 includes the following seven most important trends:</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="customerexperience">1. <strong>The Experience of the Customers</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The newest trend in the creation of a digital marketing strategy refers to the focus on the customers and their experience. Companies can no longer rely on attracting customers through their old marketing strategies. Instead, they need to direct their attention to providing an excellent experience to the customers in order to get them to come back and continue purchasing their products or using their services over and over again. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Nowadays, with the rise of the popularity of online content, customers can read about other customers’ first-hand experiences with the products they want to buy or with the services they want to utilize. Customers are no more passive entities that only believe in what they see in commercials. Instead, they are active researchers who google the internet and gather the information they need. Therefore, companies must begin thinking about offering their customers something that is more valuable than the information they will get online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Customer experience, also known as CX, is a trend on the rise that companies need to pay attention to, especially if they want to develop a successful digital marketing strategy. By doing so, a great CX will contribute to more satisfied customers and will increase the number of newly-acquired customers. Companies need to focus on their efficiency, knowledge, and friendliness in the online services they offer. Furthermore, they need to enable easier online payment options if they want to improve the overall digital customer experience. To boost a digital marketing strategy, companies must also get up-to-date technology, provide an easy-to-follow mobile experience, create a brand image and make the customer experience personalized and designed according to the latest trends.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="employeecommitment">2. <strong>Employee Commitment</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A trend in the digital marketing strategy is to keep the employees in the company satisfied but also committed to and engaged in their work. Companies that already implement the trend of keeping the customer experience on a high level, need to also pay attention to their employee engagement. In addition to the efficient and friendly service provided by the employees, they also need to show a good attitude, knowledge, and amiability towards the customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The face of the company is represented by its <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/careers/">employees</a>, therefore employers need to direct their focus on the communication between employees and customers. Getting the employees to love their job will ensure employers that their business will achieve success. For instance, when marketing managers create a digital marketing strategy, they need to love what they do in order to make the strategy a successful one. If they do not feel passion for their job, the strategy will not turn out beneficial for the business in the end. Employers need to make sure that their employees are committed to the company and its mission and values. Therefore, they need to make the employees feel happy at work and as an important part of the company.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="voicesearch">3. <strong>Voice Search and Interaction</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Voice search and interaction is one of the digital marketing trends for 2019 that plans to continue growing in 2020. Companies need to implement the voice search trend in their content and digital marketing strategy for 2020. Both voice search and voice interaction will continue to improve due to the increased usage of personal assistants such as Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/pexels-photo-977296-2-1024x635.jpg" alt="Amazon's smart speaker" data-id="3590" class="wp-image-3590"/><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption"><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/black-amazon-echo-on-table-977296/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The voice search affects mostly the SEO content strategy of a company because the written search will not be the same as the voice search. In other words, the keywords strategy made for written search will not be valid for voice search. As a solution to this, companies will have to either combine both searches and make one keyword analysis for both of them, or make two separate keyword analyses and optimize the content for both. The best option is to optimize the content for both written and voice search.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="seoandpositionzero">4. <strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Position Zero</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the voice search trend will affect SEO and the content strategy which forms part of the digital marketing strategy. In 2020, people will begin to change the way they use search engines such as Google. Therefore, businesses will no longer primarily need to aim for getting in the first place in the search engine results pages (SERPS). Google is constantly making changes, so the search and browsing behavior is also changing consequently. Furthermore, businesses will need to focus on getting at the top of the SERP, right above the organic results.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The featured snippet which is located at the top of the SERP is called Position Zero (also known as “Quick Answers”, or answer box). To get in the Position Zero, businesses need to work on their organic SEO. Google generates the results organically, searches for offered answers to the question programmatically, picks the best one and displays it in the Position Zero of the SERP. To be even considered as a candidate for the Position Zero, businesses need to be ranked in the first five results of the first page of search results. Moreover, the information must be relevant and it is a great advantage if the content is displayed in formatting useful for the searchers.</p>

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="dominationofvisuals">5. <strong>The Domination of Visuals</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With the rise of voice search over the written search, the visuals and design become as important as the written content. Therefore, the newest trends for creating a digital marketing strategy in 2020 require companies to include more and more visuals in their articles and websites than before. Proof that people like more visuals than written content can be found in the increased usage of image-focused social media platforms such as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cosmicdevelopment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)">Instagram</a> and Pinterest. Visuals nowadays are considered as the preferred option because it is easier to remember a visual than an entire written article. Therefore, including visuals, images, infographics, and videos in addition to the text on your website will bring advantages to the company’s digital marketing strategy in comparison to the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="artificialintelligence">6. <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Believe it or not, artificial intelligence (AI) will help with the development of a digital marketing strategy in 2020. So far, AI has marked an extreme advancement in the past few years and it has delved into many parts of the companies. AI is the technology that contributed to the existence of voice search, smart assistants, chatbots, etc. The number of businesses that use AI for these purposes has increased over the years. In 2020, businesses will continue implementing AI in the digital marketing strategy of a company, thus creating a better customer experience and a database for the company’s customers and their needs. However, companies need to remember that this technology can serve as an enhancement of human efforts, not as a replacement of the human force entirely.&nbsp;Read more about the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/is-machines-vs-humans-the-real-battle-of-the-future/">battle of the future</a> between machines and humans.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="popularityoflivevideo">7. <strong>The Popularity of Live Video</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When creating a digital marketing strategy, companies need to know that videos are an inseparable part of the strategy, if they want to follow the latest trends. In the last few years, videos were very popular among consumers who wanted to learn more details about new products. However, in 2020, people are expected to watch more live videos than pre-recorded ones. And why is that? That is due to the fact that people have an inner desire to always be the first that get new information. Live videos give the audience the opportunity to actively participate in the fresh and exciting news they are about to watch, rather than just sit and passively watch pre-recorded videos. Nowadays, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Facebook (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.facebook.com/cosmicdevelopment/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cosmicdevelopment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)">Instagram</a> are the two <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-tips-for-improving-social-media-marketing/">social media</a> platforms that have an audience that is actively participating in live videos. And this is just the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My Cosmic journey started back in 2011. I was one of the first six people that Cosmic hired at the time. I still remember my first day at the office, like it was yesterday. We were all new employees and it felt pretty much like the first day at school, but this time for grown-ups :) . We were all very excited about the new job positions and the new office environment at the beginning. Yet we felt nervous and uneasy as we all took part in a new venture that was still to be proven. From this point of view, I can only say that all of those “worries” were unnecessary as everything turned out just fine. Looking back, I can say I joined Cosmic when it was still a concept, an idea, and now I’m glad that I’ve been doing my part to make that idea a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Your path from Client and Office Manager to Senior Business Consultant is impressive. How did you manage to handle the transition?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Well, that won’t be the only transition I made in Cosmic. When I joined the company, I was working for a client at first, just like everyone else in the company. Later, I became a Team Lead and after a short while, I was given the chance to become an Office Manager. Once I proved to be hardworking enough and successful in the above, I dived into the Business Development section. Like all transitions, it comes with many unforeseen situations and requires a lot of work and enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Being a Senior Business Consultant is a much more responsible position than the ones you held before. How do you cope with the demands of your job?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Every job entails a list of responsibilities that the employee must cope with. I consider myself not only a hard-working person but also as one of those employees who are thirsty for knowledge and are always on the lookout for new experiences. Moreover, I tend to learn as much as I can on a daily basis. I like to read everything that might help me with my job - from online articles to books (both hard-copy and e-versions). Apart from my personal effort, I’m lucky to have enormous support from the upper management of Cosmic Development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The effort you put into your work is impressive. Seems like you truly love what you do! When did you discover that you want to be a Business Consultant?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I believe that I got it along the way. At first, it was more like a challenge and an opportunity to contribute more to the success of the company. But then, it seems like everything clicked. It’s hard to give proper reasoning, I must admit. This is probably the best explanation I can give as I believe all crucial decisions in our lives are made with the help of our subconscious minds. We just feel it’s the right thing to do, without being able to name proper reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a summary, I would give a piece of short advice to young people who want to make career development or career change. I know that it is not easy to take a risk or to make changes overnight, but if they want to advance in their careers, they have to try. My best advice for them is just to listen to their inner self and to take challenges that are worth their time and effort. By doing so, success is guaranteed and career advancement is inevitable.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ll try to be short on this one. As probably most of the employees in the IT industry do, I read all influencing tech-related sites. The websites that I tend to visit daily are the following: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank">techcrunch.com</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mashable.com/" target="_blank">mashable.com</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digitalagencynetwork.com/" target="_blank">digitalagencynetwork.com</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/" target="_blank">digitaltrends.com</a>. I would also add to the list <a href="https://dailyhive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">dailyhive.com</a> as of recent. However, this list is ever-changing and evolving. I happen to find myself exploring new sites every once in a while, in order to stay on track with the latest trends in the IT industry.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a Senior Business Consultant, I have so far used various tools that alleviated my job. The constant tool that I use at the moment is the CRM tool - <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://close.com/" target="_blank">Close.com</a>. If you want to discover what it can provide as a CRM, you can read the article that I wrote by following this <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/crm-why-i-love-using-close-com/">link</a>. In addition, I use other tools that are only a matter of testing and finding better ones along the way.

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It may sound odd, but one of my favorite heroes is my grandfather Nikola, my father’s father. He is a truly remarkable person. Right now, he leads an active family life at the age of 87. As a retired Mechanical Engineer, he keeps his mind busy and learns something new constantly. He often says to me: “To lead a healthy lifestyle, you have to keep both your mind and body in shape”. That is where I get my inspiration from and other heroes I meet every now and then. These are people who are exceptions, extraordinary and unique in their own way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Not sure if it’s an achievement but having a loving family is the first thing that comes to my mind. I have a supporting husband and two cute boys, who mean the world to me and who make my life better every day. They are more than an achievement actually, they are my reason to live. They teach me how to be a better person in general, not only in the role of a mother.</p>

I try to enjoy the little things in life like riding a bike to work (in spring and summer only :) ). I want to be drinking coffee in silence, watching a great movie once in a while, going to the theater or to a concert, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The web development trends are subject to constant change as time passes by. With the end of 2019 and the end of a whole decade, the technologies that were trending in web development begin to differ from those that are about to take over. If you are already familiar with web development practices, then you probably know that companies constantly make changes to their strategies and follow world trends in order to keep their competitiveness on a high level. That way, businesses fight hard to always be one step ahead of their competitors and implement technologies that will probably mark a new era in the web development world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The need for staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends and technologies is a must when working in a company that must follow the trends if it wants to stay ahead of the competition. We can hardly wait to see which are the newest technologies that will mark the following decade. If you want to discover why you need to keep up with the latest trends in web development, continue reading about six of the trends of our choice:&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="lowcodedevelopment"><strong>Low-Code Development</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to web development, throughout the past few years, a new trend called low-code development has appeared. Low-code development is an approach that allows programmers to build applications without coding, by simply using visual interfaces or platforms. In this case, developers will not be required to create code because the code will be created automatically and they will only have the option to modify it. Moreover, they will need to arrange prebuilt components by dragging and dropping them on the low-code development platform.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Low-code development was at first used for building applications on platforms for specific software, such as <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/crm-why-i-love-using-close-com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CRM (opens in a new tab)">CRM</a>. However, from 2020 onward, low-code platforms will be on the rise and more low-code applications will be built easily thanks to these platforms. Small businesses, start-ups, and enterprises will mostly use the benefits of low-code development because it offers faster deployment and covers the lack of UX resources. Moreover, companies that implement low-code development will be able to easily validate their business ideas and will face fewer risks throughout the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="mixedreality"><strong>Mixed Reality (MR)</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Mixed Reality (MR) is not a new trend in web development, however, it is expected to take a stronger swing in the decade that begins right now. Last year, the increased usage of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) was one of the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/5-digital-marketing-trends-you-need-to-know/">digital marketing trends</a> on the rise. In 2020, this trend will continue to dominate not only in the world of digital marketing but also in software development. Companies will use this MR technology as a way to realize their business values, especially if they fall into the following sectors: gaming, architecture and construction, defense, healthcare, tourism, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">MR technology can be utilized in various different segments, depending on the nature of the business. For instance, architecture and construction companies may use MR in order to improve their designs by implementing 3D modeling in a VR environment. Moreover, both government and non-profit organizations can use VR and AR to train their employees. Furthermore, businesses that use VR and AR will be able to provide their customers with the opportunity to try and examine their products virtually, thus increasing their sales effort. Therefore, implementing the MR in the company’s software can only improve the business process and lifestyle. Continue observing the development of this trend in the decade that has just begun and make sure to implement it in your business.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="artificialintelligence(AI)"><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Artificial Intelligence is a trend that started emerging in the past several years but will continue to ascend in the decade that has just started. Businesses more and more implement AI in their software development strategy. For those who still do not know what AI is: it is a computer-science branch that enables machines to perform tasks that only humans could have done till now. Although experts believe that the future lies in AI, they cannot but wonder what will happen to human intelligence in the future. That is why we wonder whether <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/is-machines-vs-humans-the-real-battle-of-the-future/">the real battle of the future</a> will actually happen between machines and humans or not?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to the influence of AI over software development, it can help in building a facial recognition software for law enforcement agencies, for instance, by implementing its image and video recognition capabilities. Software developers with the help of AI and Machine Learning (ML) will be able to automate low-end tasks. Moreover, AI may help in processing data of all patients that are served at healthcare organizations, or in improving the customer service operations by implementing chatbots on all websites. Regardless of the way that companies will implement the AI, it will make their lives easier and will mark the beginning of a new era.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the list of web development trends that are expected to mark the new decade belongs the blockchain technology. Blockchain consists of several blocks that are connected with the help of cryptography.  Each of the blocks contains a list of records and a cryptographic hash of the previous block which is designed to resist any modification that could be possibly done to the data. Blockchain is a P2P (peer-to-peer) network that businesses use for running smart contracts and for improving companies’ trust. This trend increases accountability and data safety, allows creating smart contracts, and provides ultimate transparency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The increased use of blockchain technology is due to several advantages that it brings to companies. Blockchain improves supply-chain management thus simplifying the process that involves a lot of paperwork and manual processes. Moreover, it offers audit trail and endurance to analytics software and companies of different sectors use it for running their analytics tools on reliable data. Blockchain also offers improvements in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) and in its processes by dealing with a lot of identity information stored in silos. Finally, blockchain is a technology that brings security to the Internet of Things (IoT) thanks to its features that secure the communication between different devices over the Internet. Overall, the blockchain development is expected to mark a great growth from 2020 onward, so we can hardly wait to see what it has in store.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="cybersecurity"><strong>Cybersecurity</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cybersecurity is one of the web development trends which companies must consider to implement when they want to build solutions for their enterprises. In the new decade, cybercrimes are expected to increase in number, thus causing companies to lose billions of dollars. Therefore, they will have to start considering the best solution that will keep them safe from such so-called cybercrimes. Cybersecurity is a key factor when building enterprise solutions, especially when protecting a business from cybercriminals who can commit a variety of online crimes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Small businesses or start-ups are usually the perfect targets for cybercriminals because they believe that they will not be attacked due to their size. However, cyber-attackers pick these small businesses as their first targets and gain access to their data and customers’ personal information. Therefore, cybersecurity will begin flourishing more and more among small companies in the years to come. However, this does not mean that only small businesses need to invest in cybersecurity. All companies are encouraged to follow this trend and to take into consideration the fact that cybersecurity is useful for them.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Possessing the needed personality traits is a mandatory action when trying to begin a new profession, regardless of whether it is in the IT industry or in another type of corporation. To become web developers, people need to first ensure that they have at least five basic personality traits that will help them adjust to the new profession. Being a web developer is definitely not an easy job, however, it is a profession that is currently in high demand on the market. Due to that fact, many people nowadays make a life decision about changing their profession and becoming web developers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The rapid change of the market and the trending peak of certain professions are the main reasons why employees want to try something new. One of those trending job positions that mark a high peak on the market is <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/">software development</a>. Companies are more and more on the lookout for web developers, due to their need for such professionals who will help them keep an online presence. Therefore, software development will continue to grow rapidly because companies will always need websites and applications to promote their services or products. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These are more than enough reasons to make a change in your profession and become a web developer. However, how will you know that this is the right job for you? If you want to discover whether you should become a web developer or not, you must check whether you possess the mandatory personality traits for novice software developers. For more information, read the following five obligatory personality traits that you must have:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="#selftaught">Be a Self-Taught Person</a></li><li><a href="#patiencepersistence">Show Patience and Persistence</a></li><li><a href="#constructivecriticism">Be Open to Constructive Criticism</a></li><li><a href="#proudofworkdone">Become Proud of the Work Done</a></li><li><a href="#learnnewtechnologies">Be Ready to Constantly Learn New Technologies</a></li></ul>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="selftaught"><strong>Be a Self-Taught Person</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first personality trait that web developers need to have is the preparedness to be self-taught programmers. In other words, people who are capable of learning on their own will be the ones that will most probably succeed as web developers. We all know that both the hard and <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-soft-skills-for-software-developers/">soft skills</a> of a professional are not entirely taught in a classroom. Instead, programmers need to work on their own if they want to improve their professional skills such as <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-improve-communication-skills-for-the-it-pro/">communication</a>, time management, leadership, flexibility, teamwork, etc. Companies who want to hire web developers expect the candidates to know the basics of programming without the need for training them for their job positions. Therefore, programmers need to be individuals who will be self-taught and who will have no problem learning on their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Web developers need to have in mind that they will have to show different skills and knowledge, depending on the project in which they will be involved. So, programmers need to get themselves prepared for different types of engineering and fill in their developers’ portfolios with a range of skill sets. This is the individual work that is part of the self-taught process and which they need to complete in order to get companies to hire them.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="patiencepersistence"><strong>Show Patience and Persistence</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The job of a web developer may oftentimes be very stressful. Therefore, when employers want to hire software developers for their company, they need to assess the applicants’ patience, temperament, and stability. Web developers will most likely be hired if they possess these qualities as their best personality traits. Moreover, being patient and persistent in the work and goal achievement will also make the novice programmers become better developers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When working as web developers, employees not only need to possess the above-mentioned qualities but also must be ready for a frustrating job. Oftentimes, the previous programmer who worked on the project might have left an unreadable code. Moreover, the documentation might be wrong or even outdated. In such situations, the new web developers will have to deal with potential problems left from their previous colleagues. They will be required to show patience and persistence in their work. When working as software developers, employees cannot have mood swings or outbursts of anger if they cannot find a solution to the problem in front of them. Therefore, people who want to become web developers need to pay more attention to their natural balance, because otherwise, they will be unable to work as programmers if they easily get upset.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="constructivecriticism"><strong>Be Open to Constructive Criticism</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To be a successful web developer, one of the personality traits that a person must possess is to be always open to constructive criticism. Handling criticism as a pro is what helps programmers establish good connections with other team members and accept their ideas. In big companies, programmers are usually expected to work as part of a large team of developers. Consequently, they will have to improve their listening skills and accept criticism from their colleagues. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In many situations, one programmer may often have different solutions to a problem than the others. In such situations, novice web developers must be open to different ideas and accept that their solution is not the only way to do things. Therefore, prior to beginning a career in web development, applicants need to reflect on whether they are open-minded individuals or not. If they are - they will easily adjust to the work position. If not - then they will have difficulties in working as web developers.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="proudofworkdone"><strong>Become Proud of the Work Done</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When working as a web developer, employees usually have neither emotional connection to their work nor personal investment in the products or services they offer on the market. In most cases, programmers only put enough effort to complete their daily tasks and get a paycheck at the end of the month. They do not get emotionally attached to the software that the team develops, which after a while results in lowering the level of enthusiasm for work.&nbsp;To prevent this from happening, web developers need to start taking part in the act of creation at their workplace and become proud of the work they have completed. That way, they will feel like they have made a change to the world they live in and that they will ease the lives of people who will use their software. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Web developers need to be enthusiastic and innovative in their jobs, so they are encouraged to assess the product they develop from different angles. They ought to think like engineers while creating the software, but also must put themselves in the shoes of the owners and make the needed improvements. Moreover, programmers must also understand the users’ requirements and accustom the software according to the desire of the potential user. Taking all these requirements in mind will not only help developers with the development of the software but also will make them proud in the end and they will feel like they have contributed to better user experience.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="learnnewtechnologies"><strong>Be Ready to Constantly Learn New Technologies</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When starting off as a web developer, one of the personality traits of novices will be the ability to learn new technologies. And the most important thing is that they will not stop learning at some point in their career. The web development world is constantly changing following the latest trends that happen in the IT industry. Therefore, programmers will have to learn new technologies all the time in order to upgrade themselves and stay up-to-date. In addition, they will also need to learn programming languages and read <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/programming-books-that-developers-must-read/">programming books</a> that will help them with their daily work. However, the first and necessary technologies that web developers need to learn at the very beginning of their career are the following:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>MySQL Database</li><li>PHP, Java, NodeJS</li><li>Frameworks</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After reading these five simple personality traits that novice web developers need to possess in the decade that has just begun, the number of people interested in becoming programmers will probably rise. However, take into consideration that being a software developer is a demanding job and that requires dedication and hard work. If you consider yourself as one of those types of people, make the first step, be persistent and never give up. Start your internship today and afterward check out the job positions we offer at our <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/careers/">Careers page</a> to give yourself a chance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Python is an interpreted programming language that marked a significant rise in the past decade. Web developers who choose Python as their programming language are enabled to integrate their systems more effectively and work at a faster speed. Moreover, when programmers utilize Python, they opt for an increase in the users’ productivity and a decrease in their maintenance costs. Programmers use Python for the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/">web development</a> of various types of desktop and web applications, mobile apps, websites, and others.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Python was invented in 1989 by Guido Van Rossum, who wanted to reduce the flaws of the ABC programming language, especially its lack of extensibility. His personal experience with error handling and with ABC made him become “aware of the importance of exceptions as a programming language feature”. Therefore, he decided to develop a new programming language, which he named “Python”. Many people think that the inspiration for the name of this programming language comes from the snake python, but instead, its name comes from the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Python is an interactive programming language that uses very clear syntax combined with remarkable power. It is extensible in C or C++ and has interfaces to many libraries and system calls. This programming language is created to incorporate different modules, classes, exceptions, as well as high-level dynamic data types. Developers can use Python for big data analytics, but it also has many other advantages, which is why it is considered as the programming language of the new decade. These are only a few essential advantages of using the Python programming language in the new decade:</p>

<h2 id="easytouse"><strong>Easy-to-Use and Highly Effective</strong> Programming Language</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Technology is improving with every passing day, and people try to make their lives less complicated. Python is a programming language that simplifies coding due to its easily readable syntax and easy-to-use features. The simplicity of Python is one of the most important reasons why it is the main programming language used for Machine Learning (ML). Python’s syntax may be easily used by both experienced developers, as well as by beginners or students. Developers who use the Python programming language can focus on solving potential difficulties with ML instead of wasting their time on understanding the technical problems that might happen.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition to the ease of using Python as a programming language, developers can say with pride that this language is also highly effective. Other programming languages usually require the writing of countless lines of code. However, Python offers developers the possibility to finish a larger number of tasks with fewer lines of code. In addition, the code written in Python is easily readable and understandable. This is another of the reasons why this programming language is ideal for ML and creating such models.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="adaptivenature"><strong>Adaptive Nature</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Python is one of the most eminent programming languages which will continue trending in the new decade, thanks to its adaptive nature. In the past few years, developers have wasted a lot of their time on programming in different languages. With Python, this loss of time will be reduced to a minimum. Why is that? Because Python is a programming language that easily performs cross-language operations. The adaptiveness of Python and its portable nature allow data scientists to train their ML on their machines. Furthermore, Python’s adaptive nature allows integration of the Python libraries with Java, .NET, and C/C++ libraries. </p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="opensource"><strong>Open-Source Programming Language</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the main reasons Python is so popular today is because of its distributive nature. Many open-source projects are done in Python because creating Python packages and installing them is easy. Python developers install packages via pip (Pip Installs Packages), which downloads and installs packages from PyPI - an online repository of Python packages. Additionally, most Python projects contain a setup script that is easy to use. According to Nikola Dokoski, our Python expert who works in our <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/about-us/">company</a>, this makes it easy to write a git project in Python and have other people contribute to it. There are over a million Python projects in Github alone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="pythonlibraries"><strong>Numerous Python Libraries</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With the rise of Python's popularity as one of the most dynamic programming languages, the number of libraries has increased. Nowadays, there are hundreds of Python libraries that developers may use to save their valuable time spent on programming. Some of the Python libraries have been specially created for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). For instance, Keras is one of the open-source libraries written in Python, which focuses mainly on neural networks. In addition, there are also other libraries written in Python, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Pandas</li><li>Matplotlib</li><li>SciPy (Scientific Python)</li><li>NumPy (Numerical Python)</li><li>Scikit-learn</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Pandas is the most widely-known open-source library written in Python for data analysis, which handles the basic maintenance and operation of structured data. Moreover, Matplotlib is a Python library that is excellent for data visualization and which enables its users to plot graphs in numerous types (pie charts, histograms, bar graphs). That is the main reason why Matplotlib is considered as the best plotting library for Python programming that any person can easily understand. SciPy is a library that deals with science, engineering, and mathematics. NumPy deals with numerical functionalities mainly, but also with linear algebra and other number capabilities. Scikit-learn is an open-source library for ML, which enables classification, regression, and clustering algorithms and which can be integrated with SciPy and NumPy.</p>

<h2 id="pythonframeworks"><strong>Plentiful Python Frameworks</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to Python frameworks, we asked again our colleague Nikola to share his favorite ones from his personal working experience. According to him, several frameworks make Python a competitive programming language in today's web development sphere. Some of the more popular frameworks of his choice are Django, Flask, and Tornado WebServer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Nikola's first choice is Django - the most popular web development framework for Python. It is an MVC (Model View Controller) framework that standardizes a project's layout by separating the project into apps but still utilizes Python's flexible nature by allowing the developer to use third-party packages, or even to write their own. On the other hand, he considers Flask as a much simpler framework which does not limit the developers by having a specific project structure, but still allows many options for organizing their code. This leaves the developers with more freedom of how they will organize their code and what modules they will use. Finally, his third choice is Tornado WebServer - a very bare-bone framework that implements web server functionalities and leaves the business logic to the developer, allowing them a great degree of freedom.</p>

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="onlinecommunity"><strong>Strong Online Community</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the main advantages of the Python programming languages lies in its strong online community and the immense public support. The corporate and public support of the Python programming language only enables programmers to increase their knowledge of Machine Learning (ML), regardless of whether they are experienced or inexperienced developers. Moreover, thanks to the enormous online community, both Python and ML get easily promoted. Therefore many tutorials can be found on the internet. Corporate support has also played a great part in the online expansion of Python for ML. For instance, Google is one of the corporate supporters that have created many Python libraries.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have been part of Cosmic Development for more than five years. An excellent proof of being with Cosmic for over five years is the recognition award that I received from the company at the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/highlights-of-our-team-building-2019/">annual team building</a> in Mavrovo in November 2019. My Cosmic journey began in 2014 when a friend of mine who worked at Cosmic asked me if I wanted to join the company. Luckily, the project that I worked on at that time was about to finish and Cosmic was in the need of a web developer for their client Bookmark Inc. The client had a Web Builder Project for which I had enough previous experience. It was a perfect match. My knowledge of creating web builders gave me a push and made me decide to join the team of <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/">software developers</a> and to become part of the Cosmic family.</p>

<h3>What was the biggest challenge for you when you started working for Cosmic Development?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Every beginning at a new company is challenging at first. For me, my biggest challenge when I started working at Cosmic Development was to adjust to the company’s culture. I was used to a more relaxed working environment as a result of the culture we had established in the company where I worked previously. When I began working at Cosmic, I perceived the company’s culture as one of a closed type, where the employees only focused on their work assignments without spending time on fun activities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Maybe this was just a first impression for a newbie like myself at the time. However, this was something that very soon began to change. Both my colleagues and I were responsible for making the atmosphere more relaxed. Nowadays, Cosmic has a totally different culture in the office and it is a real joy to work here because we all motivate each other to have a good <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/guide-to-work-life-balance-for-web-developers/">work-life balance</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>You are a VP of Engineering for more than five years. Could you tell us what are your daily work responsibilities?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Every job has a different scope of responsibilities. My main daily work responsibilities as a VP of Engineering for Bookmark consist of managing a diverse team of developers and engineers and making sure that the basic requirements are met while the consistency of user experiences is satisfactory. Moreover, my responsibilities include not only managing and mentoring developers but also collaborating with product managers and improving the company’s standards. In addition to these activities, I also am responsible for ensuring quality end products, recommending technological developments and improvements, and contributing to recruitment activities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To avoid bothering you further with my everyday work activities, I will try and present to you my daily work-life responsibilities through code:</p>

<h3>Throughout the years, you probably have encountered some difficult situations. Can you mention one of the biggest challenges as a VP of Engineering and how did you resolve it?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Every job has its own challenges and difficulties. Similarly, becoming a VP of Engineering was also challenging and difficult in its own way. However, I have always managed to deal with challenges in the work. I can say that our biggest difficulty came when we started negotiating with Moneris Solutions to come on board and to become a strategic partner for Bookmark. I consider myself a tech guy and therefore I can say that I do not enjoy long meetings. However, this negotiating situation involved constant meetings that took place every day for a whole year. It was a very demanding job to be present at all meetings and to complete all other tasks on time. Thank God that all that is in the past and now we have our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cosmicdevelopment/posts/2623590527688781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="biggest strategic partner Moneris Solutions (opens in a new tab)">biggest strategic partner Moneris Solutions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What are your favorite “know-how” sources?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are many useful sources for software development solutions that can be found online. Software developers and other IT pros can easily learn everything they need about the industry by simply googling the problem. Therefore, my favorite “know-how” source is Google. You can always discover some helpful and practical advice on Google. You can also post a question to the community or share your thoughts and ideas on one of the numerous forums that can be found on Google.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What is the best piece of advice that you would give to young developers?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When working as a software developer, you can hear many pieces of advice from different colleagues, depending on their personal experience. When I look at younger developers, I cannot but say to them the following: <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/steve-jobs-told-students-stay-hungry-stay-foolish/2011/10/05/gIQA1qVjOL_blog.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Stay Hungry Stay Foolish!</a></strong> This is a famous quote used by Steve Jobs when he addressed students in one of his speeches. Similarly, I can give younger developers the advice that only by being hungry to try new things and foolish enough to try things that everyone told you is impossible you can make them happen.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>We heard that you also have a cooking blog. How did that happen?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is actually an interesting story. For a long time I used to lead an unhealthy lifestyle and I ate unhealthy as well. One day, a friend of mine took me to a restaurant with deliciously cooked food. When I tasted the food there, I said to myself that I must learn how to cook like that. This does not mean that I am eating healthy now. I am still eating unhealthy food, but it tastes better. :)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">During the process of learning how to cook, I wanted to write down the recipes in a place that will not be lost eventually. I did not want to save the recipes in a notebook that I might lose, or on a laptop that will soon become garbage. Therefore, I decided to start a blog with all the recipes I learned so far. Parts of those blog articles have my own personal notes about the recipe in question so that I can always go back and remember it as a diary.</p>

<h3><strong>What are your greatest professional or personal accomplishments until now?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is the most difficult question for me because I have different accomplishments during my life and I cannot pick only one or two. I can say that I have given my best in each aspect of my life and that is enough of an accomplishment. First of all, I am a professional web developer who became a VP of Engineering. I am also a successful blogger, great cook, and even greater bike rider. Finally, I can say that I am a responsible and proud father. Each of my accomplishments made me what I am today.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When someone mentions fun, the first thing that comes to my mind is my bicycle. I enjoy riding bikes and baking pizza. Recently I discovered the joy of riding mountains with a bike and I am absolutely thrilled by nature and by the whole experience. I am even thinking of starting a biking blog, just like I started the cooking blog years ago. My friends say that ever since I began riding a bike, I have lowered the number of posts about food on Instagram, which was what I used to do before.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">When building a start-up company, owners need to begin considering outsourcing as an option that will help their business grow. Choosing outsourcing services may turn out beneficial for every business that is on the market, regardless of whether it is a start-up or a big corporation. For a long time, business owners thought that outsourcing is a strategy only for big organizations. However, start-ups are also recommended to learn <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-outsourcing-can-benefit-your-business/">how outsourcing can benefit their business</a> before launching their company on the market. Moreover, they need to know which outsourcing services to choose, in order to save their resources and to focus on their core activities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development is an IT support services company that offers outsourcing services to all the countries in the world. Although our company is based in Canada, we have other operation centers in Europe, or to be precise: in Serbia and Macedonia.

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With the growth of digital technologies, web developers are the employees that are most wanted for creating software or web solutions for different types of companies. Both start-ups and big corporations are in the need of software developers who will create websites, mobile and web applications, software, e-commerce solutions, web designs, etc. In most cases, companies want to get outsourcing services for the creation of their websites or their new applications. Furthermore, they also need experts who know how to make good web designs or who have ready templates that the business owners can choose from.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition to these basic web development services that can be outsourced, the role of a cybersecurity expert is also trending nowadays. Companies often wonder whether to choose outsourcing as a way of improving their Internet security. Hiring professionals who will resolve potential cybersecurity issues remotely is a good idea when business owners cannot find the appropriate individual for the job or when they realize that they do not have enough resources for a proper in-house employee.&nbsp;Discover more about cybersecurity and why you need to implement it by reading the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/newest-web-development-trends-for-2020/">newest web development trends for 2020</a>.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to outsourcing services that belong to the group of digital marketing and sales, business owners need to decide which services should they have in-house and which can be outsourced. For instance, there are plenty of marketing agencies and sales experts that can cover those job positions from a remote workplace. However, the managers of both marketing and sales teams should work closely together and be present at the office, for better synchronization between the teams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When launching a start-up company, owners can consider hiring outsourcing services like digital marketing and sales in order to save their time and to promote their brand successfully. Companies that are found in such a situation can consider hiring digital marketing experts from companies such as ours. We offer digital marketing and sales as outsourcing services from a team of professionals who know how to bring benefits to your business. And instead of paying several separate salaries for each employee, you will want to get a team of experts for one price.&nbsp;Below are further discussed four main areas of the digital marketing and sales services that we offer.</p>

<h6>1. <strong>Social Media Marketin</strong>g</h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As part of the digital marketing strategy of any company, business owners also need to have experts in the field of <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-tips-for-improving-social-media-marketing/">social media marketing</a>. Most companies believe that dedicating one hour per day on social media marketing is enough, but this is not right. They need to invest time in their social media strategy if they want to grow the number of their followers. Choosing to outsource social media marketing experts is crucial for businesses that want to be present in online media and on social media platforms such as: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc… We have professionals in our company who can easily monitor your connections on all social media and engage in separate conversations with them.&nbsp;</p>

<h6>2. <strong>Content and Technical Writers / Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong></h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The outsourcing services also include services such as content or technical writers. Content or technical writing is needed for <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/">blog</a>, advertising, social media platforms and all other aspects of the digital marketing strategy. Failing to invest in written content may prove to be wrong for the company’s entire strategy. Content and technical writing takes a lot of time, effort and practice, so companies need to have this in mind when creating their content strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In a tight correlation with content and technical writing is Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Without written content, the company’s website will not be optimized for search engines such as Google. Therefore, start-up owners need to hire SEO experts to handle their content and to make a strategy that will place them higher on the search engine results pages (SERPs). SEO is one of the outsourcing services that companies may get from companies like ours.&nbsp;To learn more about current trends in creating a digital marketing strategy for 2020, read our article by following <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/trends-in-creating-a-digital-marketing-strategy-for-2020/">this link</a>.</p>

<h6>3. Sales and Email Management</h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A very important aspect of the company’s marketing and sales strategy is to pay special attention to the email management. It is definitely not an easy task to know what type of emails to send to which category of people. Therefore, companies are encouraged to contract experts that offer outsourcing services for email management, so that they can avoid being unproductive or inefficient. Nowadays, there are companies that deal with email management technology as a primary focus. Therefore, if the start-up company does not deal with this technology, business owners are encouraged to use outsourcing services for email management and get professionals to do this work.&nbsp;</p>

<h6>4. <strong>Video and Photo Editing</strong></h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the era of smartphones, photos and videos are the core of each digital marketing strategy. Every company should consider hiring a team of professionals that will know how to bring out the best of the videos and photos they publish on the company’s website or social media. For that reason, outsourcing services such as video and photo editing is the best choice that business owners can make if they want to present their companies as professional ones. On the one hand, taking pictures with a mobile phone, or recording in-house videos may only lower the product’s quality. On the other hand, hiring professionals in your country may be more expensive for your firm than what you can afford. Therefore, companies can hire remotely-working experts who can take photos, record videos and then edit them so you get better quality for a lower price.</p>

<h2 id="administrationandvirtualassistance"><strong><a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/administration-and-virtual-assistance/">Administration and Virtual Assistance Outsourcing Services</a></strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the most outsourced services are those that cover administrative responsibilities and customer support activities. Start-ups that want to lower their expenses need to consider hiring administrative and virtual assistants from other countries, thus preserving money on hiring, saving up space in their office and lowering their tax payments. In such situations, business owners can make a decision to hire customer service agents abroad for a more affordable cost. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, prior to making this decision, start-ups need to make an impeccable analysis of the countries that they want to get these outsourcing services from because they will need only remote workers who can speak English fluently. In our company, we have employees who speak English like their second tongue, because in Macedonia the children learn the English language from the beginning of primary school. Therefore, we offer fluent-English speakers who can understand the problem at hand and provide excellent customer support experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The social media trends for 2020 are a very important element of the marketing strategy that all companies must know in order to surpass their competitors and always be one step ahead. Business owners must tend to implement the latest trends in their company's strategy and get full advantage of social media platforms for attracting new customers. That way they will also improve the company's <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-tips-for-improving-social-media-marketing/">social media marketing (SMM) strategy</a>. Regardless of the size of the company, entrepreneurs need to utilize all social media that their targeted audience uses. That way they will stay on track with the latest technologies and will know how to take advantage of each social platform separately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The major social media platforms currently are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.facebook.com/cosmicdevelopment/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/cosmicdevelopment/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. In addition to them, people use other social media apps such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cosmic-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="LinkedIn (opens in a new tab)">LinkedIn</a> for B2B strategies, YouTube for reaching larger audiences, as well as other trending platforms. However, the question is: “Will this stay the same forever?” 2020 brings new social media trends that may reshape the social media landscape, especially with the emergence of new platforms that were not so popular till now. To discover more information about the latest social media trends that will dominate the new decade, read more about five of them that we chose as the most important:</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="temporarycontent">Temporary Content</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Temporary content is one of the social media trends for 2020 that companies need to pay attention to. The temporary content is also known by the term “ephemeral content” and it stands for content that is available on social media for a short period of time after which it disappears entirely. People nowadays are addicted to such temporary content because their attention span is short and they want to consume content in a rapid manner. Great examples of temporary content are Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat Stories, which disappear after 24 hours. The content shared via Stories is more engaging and acts as an addiction to users, so they spend hours scrolling through one Story after another.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Business owners who want to follow the latest social media trends must take advantage of the temporary content and publish their companies’ content on these platforms. Building a brand requires following the trends such as the temporary content. Companies tend to post a Story on one of these social media platforms at least once per week in order to stay up to date with the trends and get people’s attention. </p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="emergencenewsocialplatforms">Emergence of New Social Media Platforms</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Till now, the social media trends were revolving around the two major and most popular platforms: Facebook and Instagram. Other popular social media platforms are LinkedIn for businesses and for developing a B2B strategy, as well as Twitch for the gaming community. In the past several years, other platforms have begun increasing their dominance and approaching the already popular ones mentioned above. In 2020, other social media platforms, such as TikTok for instance, will continue emerging. Youngsters have made TikTok so popular that even companies are beginning to discover new ways how to use these platforms in their favor. TikTok is a social platform where companies can create their personalized marketing channel. This channel can be used for creating new branded videos for the company.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Once companies create their own accounts on TikTok, users can get an immediate preview of the short one-minute videos that the companies post. The company’s videos will get higher engagement even if the number of followers is very low. This is one of the advantages that TikTok offers to companies. Moreover, marketing a business on TikTok will increase the user’s engagement, due to the fact that 90 percent of TikTok users enter the app numerous times on a daily basis.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tiktok-1024x635.jpg" alt="TikTok app on a mobile phone" data-id="3932" class="wp-image-3932"/><figcaption><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/WRNPKfPwN9I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="videocontentdomination">Domination of Video Content</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another of the newest social media trends for 2020 is the increased domination of the video content. It is general knowledge that younger people do not want to waste their time reading long articles. Instead, they prefer watching short videos that will grasp their attention while providing them with beneficial information at the same time. Video content is engaging users regardless of whether it is in a short format for TikTok or Stories, or it is in a long format as the videos for YouTube. In 2020, most of the online content is expected to be converted into video content, adapted for each of the social media platforms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Companies that have not yet created video content are advised to begin with their content strategy in order to keep up with the latest social media trends. Furthermore, they need to become aware of how to use Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for optimizing their video content and obtain a high position on the Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). To begin, business owners can begin uploading Stories on their social media platforms and then pass over to longer videos for YouTube.</p>

<h2 id="socialcommerceexpansion">Expansion of the Social Commerce</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In 2020, social commerce will continue to expand as one of the social media trends that are going to mark the new decade. Popular brands have been using social media platforms to sell their products. The most used platforms for social commerce in the past years have been Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest. In the new decade that has just begun, business owners expect social commerce to be the new retail channel, in addition to websites and offline stores.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Social commerce is one of the social media trends that is expected to continue growing through the introduction of features such as posts that enable online shopping. Business owners who have recognizable brands will continue using social commerce for improving their sales strategies. Companies plan to use social networks and evolve them to retail platforms that will help their brands to sell their products easily. That way social commerce will continue trending and business owners will carry on with shoppable posts on social media. </p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="reshapingofthesocialmedialandscape">Reshaping of the Social Media Landscape</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The final and most interesting social media trend for 2020 is the possibility of having the social media landscape reshaped. In the last year, there has been a rumor that social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram will remove the number of likes under every photo. Removing the number of likes on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram is due to the fact that people see the number of likes as a determination of their social value. This in many cases has proven to be very bad for people’s mental health and that is why Facebook and Instagram plan to reshape the social media landscape by removing the number of likes thus preventing a social value to be added to each person.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, if these media platforms reshape the social media landscape, brands will be unable to measure the impact of their Facebook or Instagram campaigns. Removing the number of likes from the two most popular social media platforms may cause problems with the companies' campaigns. However, this may also prove to be useful for brands because they may get encouraged to invest their money in Facebook and Instagram Ads and track the Return on Investment (ROI). Getting marketers to use the ads features could also cause a major transformation in the social media marketing strategy. If this works, other social media may try and do the same reshaping method by removing the number of likes. We can hardly wait and see whether this trend will happen or not.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Coronavirus (COVID-19)?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronaviruses (CoV) that has not been identified in humans before, and that first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan (China). Coronaviruses are already known to cause illnesses from a simple cold to more severe diseases like the ones from the past years: MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted between animals and people. It is believed that the Coronavirus was transmitted from an animal onto a human being in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan (China).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to the World Health Organisation (WHO): “Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.” To prevent the infection from spreading, people must wash their hands regularly, cover their mouths and noses when sneezing or coughing, and they need to eat only thoroughly cooked meat and eggs. Furthermore, people are advised to avoid any contact with people who show symptoms of respiratory illness.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Advice for Protection from the Coronavirus</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Since the Coronavirus shows symptoms as a regular cold, people need to take precautionary measures in order to protect themselves from getting the virus. Below are given important advice from the WHO that people need to do and avoid the spread of the coronavirus:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Keep hands away from eyes, mouth, and nose</strong> - One of the most important advice is to avoid touching eyes, mouth and nose with hands because the hands can easily transfer the virus if they are contaminated.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Wash hands regularly</strong> - People need to wash their hands frequently either with soap and water or with an alcohol-based hand rub, and therefore kill all possible viruses that are on their hands.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Keep a social distance from others</strong> - When someone is coughing or sneezing, people need to make sure to maintain a social distance from them of at least one meter (three feet). This distance is preferable because the small liquid droplets in the sneeze or cough may contain the Coronavirus and can be breathed in, thus transferring the disease to another person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Practice respiratory hygiene</strong> - This means that people should always cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing either with tissues or with their bent elbows to avoid spreading the virus through their small liquid droplets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Seek medical help</strong> - People who have a fever, a cough, or a breathing difficulty must seek medical attention. To do so, they need to follow the directions given by local authorities and call in advance so that the health care provider can direct them to the appropriate health facility that deals with Coronavirus.</p>

<h2><strong>Using Technology and Work from Home against the Coronavirus</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Within the last few days, big corporations such as Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft have decided to allow their employees to work from home, due to the increased number of Coronavirus cases. Google decided to close its offices in China and canceled traveling to mainland China. They also sent employees from their Dublin office to work from home. Similarly, Amazon restricted traveling to and from China and required people who had to travel to stay at home and work remotely for a period of two weeks after the trip. They also told their employees in Seattle to work from home till the end of March. The same decision may soon apply to Amazon’s offices in New Jersey and New York. Moreover, Microsoft told its employees in China to work from home.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a Senior PHP developer with over eight years of experience as a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software engineer</a>&nbsp;is not the only Riste Risafov is one of the best programmers in Cosmic Development who has become an important family member throughout the years. As a Senior PHP developer, Riste is primarily writing and reviewing code, but he also participates in the regular company's R&amp;D meetings where the implementation of new technologies is discussed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We wanted to discover more about his success at Cosmic Development, so we decided to ask him about his personal experience with the company and to share his Cosmic journey. Moreover, we were curious about what it takes to be a Senior PHP Developer and what are the key steps in such a career. Read the interview below if you are also interested in discovering more about Riste’s professional and personal accomplishments.</p>

<h4>When did you join the Cosmic Development family and what was for you the biggest challenge at the very beginning? </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My Cosmic experience began in 2015 when I joined the family as a PHP developer. But first, let me give you a little background about my previous position which I held for four and a half years. It required building a programming department from zero mostly. That refers to buying hardware, setting up the servers, programming, etc. So the biggest challenge when I joined Cosmic Development, almost five years ago, was the teamwork, or in other words: changing my mindset to get used to working as part of a team instead of doing everything on my own like with the previous job. Furthermore, another important challenge was the social aspect, the period until I got to know all of my new colleagues, the company’s culture, the time needed until I built new friendships and so on. </p>

<h4>Being a part of a team of developers can be demanding but also very rewarding. Could you tell us how do you manage to overcome stressful situations?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To overcome every situation, taking a small break is essential for me. The next step is to explain the problem step by step in detail, like a scheme, and the resolution shows by itself. It’s similar to the “rubber duck debugging” when you try to explain the problem to someone who doesn't have any programming experience. You must have a deep understanding of the problem so you can explain it with simple words. This insight may help anyone to avoid stress and to contribute to the team.</p>

<h4>If you were to offer a piece of advice to your less-experienced colleagues, what would it be?    </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to my personal opinion, there are three things that younger and less-experienced colleagues should know and those are the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Always be informed of the new things in your field of expertise. Make sure to read, follow, share trending news in your sector</li><li>Do not be afraid to ask your colleagues if you get stuck with some tasks.</li><li>Always leave your work at your desk. Home is the place where you should not bring your work, no matter what task you have and how important it is.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>As a Senior PHP Developer, you probably have several websites you read on a daily basis. What would be the top five websites of your choice?﻿    </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The most important website for PHP developers is probably <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="php.net (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.php.net/" target="_blank">php.net</a>. When working as a beginner or even as a Senior PHP developer, I believe that this is a must website for reference. It’s impossible to remember everything. Then there is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="developer.wordpress.org (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">developer.wordpress.org</a> which I used mostly in the time when I worked for LittleThings and AFV, two websites that are built on Wordpress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For the times when you are in a hurry and don’t want to reinvent the wheel, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="stackoverflow.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com</a> is a lifesaver. But be careful and make sure you don't fall for the copy/paste trap because it can create a lot of problems later on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Then there are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="laravel.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">laravel.com</a> for the Laravel framework, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="freek.dev (opens in a new tab)" href="https://freek.dev/" target="_blank">freek.dev</a> covers general PHP, Laravel, and JavaScript.&nbsp;Another website that has a lot of good posts on various topics and not only about programming subjects is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dev.to (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dev.to/" target="_blank">dev.to</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What is your greatest professional accomplishment so far?    </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When working on a project to which you are so dedicated and pay so much attention it is hard to name just one. Each project demands a different skill set to build new things. To name some of them: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.littlethings.com/" target="_blank">LittleThings</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.afv.com/" target="_blank">AFV</a>, and the current one, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Rumble (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank">Rumble</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What is your greatest achievement in your personal life outside of work?    </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">That’s easy, my baby boy. It is just amazing how he sees the world and gets happy even to the smallest and ordinary things. So, I can proudly say that he is my greatest achievement in life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>﻿Can you give our readers advice on how to be more productive at work?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Make sure to develop a work routine, rank your tasks according to their level of priority, and most importantly make sure to create a task schedule for the day and stick to it. But remember to take regular breaks (something I'm not doing well :) ) and stay hydrated. In other words, learn how to create <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="work-life balance (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/guide-to-work-life-balance-for-web-developers/" target="_blank">work-life balance</a> and you notice a great change in your level of productivity.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What do you like to do for fun?    </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I love traveling to new places around the world. That is my definition of fun. I wish I could have time to travel every month to places I have never been to before. In the meantime, I have a “to-do” list of all the beautiful places in Macedonia that I never visited in my life. The list for exploring the beauties that Macedonia has to offer is getting shorter, so I will have to start making new plans and “to-do” lists.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">“How to manage a business during the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19)?” is probably the most frequently asked question that company owners ask themselves these last few months. Coronavirus is the most recent disease that spread throughout the world in a fast and unpredictable way. And now, we are all aware that this situation will last for a longer period of time, or at least until scientists discover a cure. To slow down the spread of COVID-19, we need to stay home and isolate ourselves from other people. Therefore, we need to adjust to the idea of working online. Similarly, every company owner is encouraged to learn how to manage a business online, as long as this is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Many businesses are unable to ask their employees to finish their daily tasks from home, especially if they work in factories, transport, health workers, supermarkets, pharmacies, etc. However, those business managers who can let their workers <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/work-from-home-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">work from home</a> will not only take care of the health of their employees but will also keep their business running during the outbreak. Working remotely may be very challenging, both for the employees and for the business owners. Therefore, we decided to answer the five most frequent questions that company owners ask themselves in the period of Coronavirus. Read the answers to those questions if you want to discover how to manage a business during the Coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Which Industries are Most Affected by the Economic Crisis?</strong><br/></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The Coronavirus pandemic has taken away a thousand people’s lives, and it has also affected many industries by causing the global economic crisis of 2020. Experts have been comparing this economic crisis 2020 with the recession from 2008/9. A DW article on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-shock-vs-global-financial-crisis-the-worse-economic-disaster/a-52802211" target="_blank">Coronavirus shock vs. global financial crisis</a> mentions that some of the experts believe that the global economic crisis caused by COVID-19 will be able to recover during the second half of the year, as long as the outbreak weakens by then. Nonetheless, the Coronavirus has caused immense damages to specific industries, mostly to the aviation industry and the oil industry.<br/><br/>During the global financial crisis and the SARS outbreak, the aviation industry did not receive damages such as these that are happening right now due to the Coronavirus situation. The aviation industry received the hardest blow by the COVID-19 pandemic causing all the air traveling to be pulled to a stop and most airlines to be exposed to a threat of bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Another industry that suffers the most from the Coronavirus pandemic is the oil industry. Experts expect that oil consumption throughout the whole world will face the biggest fall ever. Moreover, COVID-19 will also have a negative influence on traveling and will cause big factories to get shut down. The global financial crisis in 2008/9 caused a demand shock, but it did not have an immense impact like the economic crisis we are currently experiencing due to the Coronavirus outbreak. <br/><br/><img alt="empty airport" src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Airline-industry.jpg"/><br/><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/jeS5GHIxwTw" target="_blank">Image source</a></p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What are the Three Significant Causes of a Recession?</strong><br/></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Forbes published an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2020/03/28/why-the-us-is-now-in-recession/#2e8c309ba5ef" target="_blank">article</a> in which the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) determines the recession as “a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in production, employment, real income, and other indicators.” The three most common causes of a recession are overvaluation of stocks, supply-side shock, and demand-side weakness. <br/><br/>These three factors are noticed in the world economy ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The overvaluation of stocks usually happens after risky investments and after an increase in the interest rates. Moreover, when a pandemic such as Coronavirus causes a recession, the cause may be a supply-side shock in a situation when the virus results in lost productivity. And finally, the third cause of a recession is the demand-side weakness, which means that there is a lack of consumer confidence and happens when an inevitable shock is a cause for layoffs. A pandemic may cause layoffs, and if the countries do not have savings, the recovery afterward may be very challenging. <br/><br/><img alt="Newspaper of the Recession during Coronavirus" src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Recession.jpg"/><br/><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/the-new-york-times-newspaper-3944377/" target="_blank">Image source</a></p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What are the Symptoms for a Recession Caused by the Coronavirus?</strong><br/></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">To determine that there is an economic crisis, companies and governments need to pay attention to the recession symptoms. The Coronavirus pandemic already caused the five most significant symptoms of recession all around the world. Therefore, companies must know how to predict a recession by recognizing these symptoms. That way, business owners can begin thinking of a solution to the problem as soon as they can. Read below the five significant recession symptoms that the Coronavirus outbreak already caused.<br/><br/><strong>1. A Rise in the Unemployment Rate<br/></strong>The first symptom of an economic crisis is the rise in the unemployment rate throughout the world. In the last month, we have witnessed a rapid increase in the unemployment rate of workers in the aviation and oil industries, in the international trade and in businesses that include managing events, hotels or cruises, etc. This is especially noticeable through the cutting down of working hours or having them reduced to zero. Furthermore, workers who are getting fired from their job positions are another sign of the rise in unemployment. The act of firing employees or lowering their working hours will happen in every country hit by the Coronavirus pandemic.<br/><br/><strong>2. Increase in the Numbers of Bankruptcies and Foreclosures<br/></strong>Another symptom of economic crisis is the increased number of bankruptcies and foreclosures, which will continue rising alongside the spread of the Coronavirus. As a result of the many people being unemployed and of the upsurge of debt load and house prices, every country will face bankruptcies, foreclosures, mortgages, and loans. Luckily, countries such as Canada that have been economically stable for many years will be able to take specific measures for helping the unemployed people who have lost their jobs due to the Coronavirus outbreak.<br/><br/><strong>3. A Decrease in Interest Rates<br/></strong>When the banks are decreasing the interest rates, it is another sign that a recession is happening. The Bank of Canada, for instance, has reduced the interest rates to one percent. Moreover, it has announced that they may implement more interest rate cuts in the future to help people in need to get loans while the Coronavirus pandemic is still actual. Following the example of the Bank of Canada, other banks and lenders also decided to lower their interest rates on loans and savings accounts. To be more informed about the two policy interest rate cuts that happened in Canada as a result of the virus, follow the information published on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/key-interest-rate/" target="_blank">Bank of Canada website</a>. <br/><br/><strong>4. A Decrease in Consumer Spending and Confidence<br/></strong>When facing an economic crisis, one of the recession symptoms is the decrease in consumer spending. In other words, The Coronavirus outbreak increased the expenditure on food and products needed for the household. However, consumer spending has decreased due to social distancing and self-isolating measures throughout the world. Besides, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/consumer-confidence" target="_blank">consumer confidence index</a> in every country will decline as a result of the reduction in consumer spending power.<br/><br/><strong>5. A Descend of the Asset Prices<br/></strong>The final symptom of a recession is the descend of the asset prices, which are very high for a long time in countries such as Canada. The Coronavirus outbreak has endangered the prices of real estate and homeownership in a lot of countries. Canada’s federal government already prepared to buy $50 billion in mortgage debts so that they can protect the country’s financial system. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/ottawa-to-buy-up-to-50-billion-in-mortgages-in-move-that-harkens-back-to-2008" target="_blank">Financial Post</a> has published the news for the $50 billion paid in Ottawa.<br/><br/><img alt="Stock Exchange Board" src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stock-Exchange-Board.jpg"/><br/><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/blue-and-yellow-graph-on-stock-market-monitor-159888/" target="_blank">Image source</a></p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What to Do in a Time of Global Economic Crisis and Recession?</strong><br/></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has already caused a global economic crisis and has led to a recession.

<p class="has-medium-font-size">People create video content on a daily basis, regardless of whether it is for personal or for professional purposes. Video content is an important aspect of every company's content strategy but is also an inseparable part of people's lives. The video content platforms, also known as video hosting platforms, enable users to create, upload and store video content. People can use these video technology platforms no matter their purpose. One of those popular video content platforms is our client's video technology solution and platform  - <a href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Rumble.com</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Ever since YouTube's algorithm began to favor mainstream outlets with big budgets, a conflict arose between YouTube and independent video content creators. People began to search for other platforms where they could publish their video content. Rumble.com is one of the platforms that enabled independent video content creators to continue uploading their videos. This was made possible thanks to Rumble's video technology solution and platform. Rumble's success has been so remarkable that at the end of 2019 they were ranked as the <a href="https://story.rumble.com/rumble-ranked-18th-fastest-growing-technology-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">18th fastest growing company in Canada</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is one of the main reasons why we decided to contact Chris Pavlovski, the founder and CEO of&nbsp;Rumble.com. We asked him to shares his insights on Rumble's purpose, the video content technology, and the services that Cosmic Development offers to help Rumble grow.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>How did you come up with the idea of creating Rumble.com? Please tell us more about Rumble.com - what is the purpose of your website, what does it display, and who is it for?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Rumble was built with the mission to offer a superior video technology solution and platform that allows creators to maximize their earnings and uncover the true value of original video content. We launched the technology back in 2013 following YouTube’s decision to stay out of the copyright management business. Since then, we’ve attracted thousands of creators and over a million pieces of original content to our platform. From old to young, we are seeing everyone use Rumble.com. All it takes is one trial run, and our community members are hooked. As of recent years, Rumble began to expand its offerings to businesses looking to use our video technology solutions, and this has turned into another area of focus for us. We really want to be the end-to-end video technology platform used by everyone, everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>How is Rumble different from other video platforms? What makes it unique?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Simple, we put our creator community and partners first. When using Rumble, creators are maximizing their earning potential and getting 60% of revenue share. Our partners are using our unparalleled video technology and are getting access to original content to optimize their revenue, too. All around, it’s a win-win situation.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>How does Rumble.com function? Who makes your team?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We have an incredible leadership team in Toronto. Most of them have been with the company from the start and have shown as loyal employees. Overall, we all work hard as a team to make Rumble possible. We also know that we cannot do this alone and have an incredible Creative, Content, and Sales team available to support.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>When did you realize that your project may benefit from outsourcing and staff augmentation services? What challenges were you experiencing before you decided to hire employees in Macedonia?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Rumble has been growing at exponential rates, so the need for additional team members was evident from the beginning. Just this past year, we were named one of the fastest-growing tech companies in all of Canada, and needless to say, we needed to expand. We outsourced to Cosmic because we needed the best workers quickly, and we knew that there is no one better than Cosmic to support us with this.</p>

<h4><strong>What is your relationship with Cosmic Development? What convinced you to use our services over another solution?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being Macedonian and a true entrepreneur, it is significant for me to strengthen the country’s economy in the best way possible. At the same time, when looking at the optimal solution to support us, I want to give back to my roots as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":4177} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cosmic-rumble-meeting_2-1024x635.jpg" alt="Cosmic - Rumble meeting" class="wp-image-4177"/><figcaption>Chris Pavlovski in a meeting at Cosmic Development</figcaption></figure>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>What service does Cosmic Development perform for you, and how do you manage your augmentative team that operates from Macedonia? </strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We have utilized Cosmic Development across many spectrums, from IT development to sales. Cosmic has been able to help us in all areas of staff augmentation. Managing a team outside of our office is something we have perfected over time, and is something I suggest all companies get good at soon enough. In order to successfully accomplish this, our managers in Toronto are very conscious of the setup and put extra effort into making it work. Specifically, we mandate daily and constant communication with all team members. We also make sure to have several meetings in person throughout the year. For instance, we make Cosmic members fly to Toronto, or we fly to Macedonia a few times per year, to work side by side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>What are the benefits for your business that came out as a result of our work together? If you have an opportunity to recommend us to others, what would you tell them?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">All-in-all Cosmic Development is a competitive advantage for us.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With the recent market turmoil caused by the Coronavirus, working with Cosmic amplifies the necessity and importance of our partnership. As a proactive company, we decided to avoid having to raise capital to fund daily operations years ago. Instead, choosing to work with Cosmic helped design our cost structure differently from competing companies, making it easier to weather storms like the one we are facing this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With their competitive pricing, quality of the teams, the level of service, and their recruitment process this was a no brainer. In addition, all their staff is dedicated and exclusive to a single client at a time. This is unique because they really bring the Rumble brand loyalty inside their Cosmic offices. If you wonder what I mean by this, just look at the team's picture below.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In many companies, finance and accounting are two different departments that perform similar tasks but include different job duties. Here at <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Cosmic Development (opens in a new tab)">Cosmic Development</a>, we combine both finance and accounting departments because the job responsibilities of accountants and finance managers include working with clients and businesses with the sole purpose of improving their finances. Our Finance and Accounting Manager is Vesna Radeski, who has been with Cosmic for more than five years. She supervises all financial aspects of the business for a long period of time, however, she also focuses on managing the company’s financial records.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Ever since Vesna joined the Cosmic family over five years ago, she has been in charge of the daily business and financial transactions. She prepares financial statements and reports for profit increase. She also knows how to achieve long-term financial goals by being a detailed and accurate person. Our finance and accounting manager does data analysis as well and creates strategies on how to improve the company’s financial performance. To learn more about Vesna and her own task priority plan, continue reading the interview below.</p>

<h4>Tell us when and how your Cosmic journey began? What was the thing that made you choose our company?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I joined Cosmic Development back in 2014. I was on maternity leave, working for another company when I got a call from a friend explaining to me that there's an open position in a really good company. Although at the beginning I was a bit restrained about this, I decided to give this opportunity a chance. And now I can say that this was one of the best decisions I have made in my life, as this journey is still going on very successfully.</p>

<h4>Before joining Cosmic, you worked in the finance and accounting industry. Tell us why did you choose the role of a Finance Manager in the first place?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The turning point was back in my high school days, in the third year when I first time met with the subject “Basics of Accounting”. While it was quite a difficult subject for the other students, I solved the given tasks without any difficulties. Until then, my primary orientation was to enroll at the Faculty for Sports,&nbsp;which obviously was a completely different&nbsp;direction than finance and accounting. :) The passion which guided me to solve the accounting tasks at high school was the force that made me change my mind and enroll at the Faculty of Economics.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After I graduated, I worked in various companies in different positions, all of them connected. I also worked in a bank and that helped me choose the job that suits me. Being a Finance Manager&nbsp;requires good organization, attention to detail, constant learning, upgrading, and following the news. And most importantly: it keeps my mind always active, which is a good thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What are the challenges you face on a daily basis as a Finance Manager?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The daily obligations can go from one extreme to another, as Finance is a broad term. Some days it could be a reconciliation of the receivables, liability, the bank accounts, another day it could be preparing the salary and everything connected to that. Furthermore, some days would require preparing a report for the supervisor or performing financial analyses and strategy.&nbsp;In finance, we also make reports and submit them to the appropriate institution (National bank, Commercial banks, PRO, etc.).&nbsp;</p>

<h4>According to your personal experience, what are the top three skills that a person must possess in order to become a successful Finance Manager?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working in Finance is a very responsible role. There are more than three skills needed to be successful in this position, but I'll do my best to summarize them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Be a well-organized and problem-solving person:&nbsp;</strong>every task needs to be done on time and impeccably as many deadlines need to be met;</li><li><strong>Be able to work under pressure:</strong> this skill is partly connected to the first one, knowing that the deadlines are “chasing you”;</li><li><strong>Possess strong written and verbal communication skills:</strong>&nbsp;all the financial data we are working on needs to be well-explained to every stakeholder, where it is needed (supervisors, banks, institutions) and sometimes to people who do not know anything about finance.</li></ol>

<h4>How do you keep up with the latest trends in the finance and accounting industry?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Many laws that reflect finance and accounting have been changed throughout the entire last year and to this very day. To work in accordance with the laws,&nbsp;you must follow the regulations of several areas as well as a continuous visit to seminars for professional development. At the same time, we use the services of a consulting company with which we harmonize the current changes and we have cooperation with a law firm. Oftentimes, I know to call other colleagues for consultation as I believe that it's very important to be open to learning and cooperation.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>How do you manage to deal with multiple priorities?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In Finance everything seems to be a priority.&nbsp;:)&nbsp;Therefore, you need to have a good plan if you want to complete all priorities. I use a simple method that has proved to be efficient throughout the years. I make a list of long-term obligations a few times in a month. In addition to that list, I also make a short-term obligations list and a priority list for obligations for the day at hand. This is something that guides me through my daily and monthly tasks.</p>

<h4>In a time of a pandemic disease outbreak such as the current Coronavirus, how do you manage to get your work done professionally and timely?&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">From the moment when the Coronavirus started spreading in our country, Cosmic Development gave us the opportunity to <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/work-from-home-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="work from home (opens in a new tab)">work from home</a>. Since Cosmic is a company that supports its employees to work remotely whenever a need arises, I had no trouble setting up everything for working from home. In addition, most of the data, documentation, and info that I need can be obtained online. The only problem I am facing during these hard times is that all institutions and banks are working in different conditions. Therefore, I face some minor difficulties and challenges, but in this situation, everyone has an understanding so it's still solvable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I must say that the most challenging thing is <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-remote-working/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="working remotely (opens in a new tab)">working remotely</a> with two small kids around you. :) They want to play all day long and they seek your attention. So, my husband and I are switching our time with them during the day, and I am working in the evening hours when they are in bed, so it is manageable.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What is your biggest professional accomplishment?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Prior to working for Cosmic Development, I worked in an audit house, where we were doing outsourcing for clients. When I accepted this job, I took the financial responsibility for all offices of Cosmic Development. I didn't have a supervisor who would have the final decision on things or who would have told me how to implement new law decisions, how to handle the inspectors and the external auditors. I felt like I had to grow up overnight,&nbsp;overcome everything&nbsp;and be aware that the role I have is very important, it has a purpose and gives me a lot of satisfaction. Meanwhile, I completed my Master's degree a year ago, while I was working hard and taking care of two children.</p>

<h4>What is your most appreciated personal accomplishment outside of work?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I can say that I am happy, which means I am happy at the moment I am. As a mother of two children, I love spending time with them. I have a supporting husband, as well as a wider family that I am very happy to have. Moreover, I have a job that makes me want to go to the office every day. I also have a bunch of close friends that I know are sincere friendships. All this is a great personal achievement for me.</p>

<h4>What do you like to do for fun?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I like to travel and I want to be in nature.&nbsp;My family is also very fond of traveling so we are using every opportunity to go on a trip and visit some new country, town, or landmark. It is fulfilling to see your kids enjoy traveling from ”little legs” and learning about other cultures and traditions. Whenever we have time on the weekends, we go to the mountain, to the sea, or on a picnic and we explore the beauties of our country.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Coronavirus pandemic spread rapidly all over the world and it caused us to stay at home in isolation so that we can keep safe from it. To help our employees deal better with the Coronavirus situation, we gave them advice on how to adjust to the idea of <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/work-from-home-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">working from home</a> and how to spend their isolation time more productively. Therefore, Cosmic Development decided to implement interactive online social tools in order to help our employees beat isolation. We decided to organize online contests and events for all our locations. In other words, Cosmic invited employees from Toronto, Skopje, Bitola, and Belgrade to participate in these online contests and events, and spend more time together with their colleagues. Read more below if you want to know more about how our employees beat isolation.</p>

<h2><strong>Cosmic Online Contests</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The rules of these online contests are very simple. Employees are supposed to take photos or videos of the activity they do in order to prove that they are worthy candidates for the contest. The photos and videos must be from the beginning of the work-from-home policy. Any employee who provides photos or videos taken on a date prior to the Coronavirus pandemic will be disqualified. The employee who will be proclaimed the winner will receive a prize upon the return at work in one of our Cosmic offices. The online contests organized by Cosmic are the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h4><strong>Most Active Employee</strong> </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first round of the Cosmic Beats Isolation online contest is titled: <strong>Most Active Employee</strong>. The purpose of this category is to see how our employees spend their free time and whether they use it to keep themselves active, healthy, and most of all, happy. On the one hand, our employees could participate in this contest if they have developed new hobbies during the Coronavirus pandemic such as making handmade jewelry, handmade accessories, and clothes, writing poetry, painting, etc. On the other hand, our employees who have a fully amazing free sports time can also participate in this online contest, especially if they practice any type of sport at home (yoga, pilates, cardio), if they cook new recipes and eat healthy food prepared by themselves, or simply if they play logic and fun games with their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our most active employee during the isolation period is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-andreev-b6a3371a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Milan Andreev</a>. He provided us with photos of all the sports activities he does on a daily basis. He stays 100% physically active: he jogs, hikes, walks in nature, climbs, and most importantly, he motivates other colleagues to stay healthy during isolation and start being active. Well done Milan, you truly deserve this award.</p>

<h4><strong>Most Creative Parent</strong> </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The second round of the Cosmic Beats Isolation online contest is titled: <strong>Most Creative Parent</strong>. The purpose of this category is to see how our employees spend their time at home with their children and what they do with them. We know that it is very challenging to keep our children at home all the time and make them stay engaged and happy during this isolation period. So, instead of letting them go out and playing with other kids, we - the parents - must find ways to keep our children engaged, and that includes us playing with them. To become the most creative parent in Cosmic, our employees need to take photos or videos of playing interactive games with their children at home, painting or drawing with them, helping them in the learning process and homework assignments, encouraging them to create handmade decorations or toys, and any other interesting ideas.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To find a way to stay at home in isolation and keep oneself occupied, we decided to create a Cosmic Recommends section. We asked our cool Cosmic employees to share with us which TV series they prefer. It's nice to get a glimpse of our colleagues' preferences during this&nbsp;Coronavirus&nbsp;period.&nbsp; By doing this, we also offer our readers a list of the most popular TV series among our employees that they can watch during the isolation period.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Gaming Wednesday</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic decided to make Wednesdays more fun and introduced several games that are available to all of its employees, regardless of their location in the world. We call these days Gaming Wednesdays. For instance, we have played two online games as part of our Gaming Wednesday tournaments, on request of our employees. We always welcome new suggestions from our employees. As a result, they have the chance to suggest new games every week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first gaming tournament is in Counter-strike. Our male employees get to enjoy a good Counter-strike game along with their colleagues from other Cosmic offices. We also invite our female employees to join this tournament and spend several hours playing this game after working hours.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The second game of our Gaming Wednesday event is Pictionary. This game is inspired by the famous charades game when one player draws a word that is written on a piece of paper. However, this time, since it is an online game, the goal of the game Pictionary is for one person to draw a picture of the object they choose and let the other players guess what the drawing is. Therefore, employees need to think of a thing they like to draw, write the name of the thing in the program, and start drawing. The person that draws the word of their choice is not allowed to use letters, numbers, or words to explain the drawing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Cosmic Bar</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We reserved the last workday of the week for our Cosmic Bar online event. Every Friday we organize an online party at a virtual Cosmic Bar where employees from all offices can hang out and enjoy the company of their colleagues. The only requirement to participate in the Cosmic Bar online event is to provide a drink of your own choice and be present in front of your computer or laptop at the designated time. The rest is our job. We play online drinking games such as “Never Have I Ever” and have fun after a long week of hard work from home. The rules of this game are probably familiar to many: for instance, one person says something they have never done, and everyone who has done that thing takes a drink. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The media and entertainment industry is one of the fastest-growing industries that have been hit hard by the Coronavirus pandemic, just like any other business. In the last decade, the media and entertainment industry has gone through an immense transformation as never before. The digital media imposed itself above the previous regular distribution methods and it urged media companies to begin adopting digital strategies as part of their regular business tasks. Moreover, digital media has introduced itself in the advertising and animation, as well as in music, radio, films, gaming, etc. By doing so, companies in the media and entertainment industry were required to embrace the latest digital strategies if they wanted to keep up with the current media trends.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And now, with the development of the situation with the COVID-19, the media and entertainment industry has been mandated to implement even more digital strategies in order to keep up with the changes that happened on a worldwide scale. Similarly, this industry will mark several significant trends from 2020 onwards throughout the new decade. But how many of those trends will truly mark the new decade and how many will be prevented from flourishing due to the Coronavirus?

<h2><strong>Video Streaming </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Video streaming has become a prominent trend throughout the years and has marked an even higher peak during the Coronavirus pandemic. By the middle of 2020, a streaming war is expected to happen in which various media companies will try to find the best way of establishing a direct relationship with their consumers. Leaders in the video streaming industry such as Netflix and Amazon have been exposed to an increase in the number of their competitors. HBO Max, Apple, Disney, and WarnerMedia have noticed the possibilities for advancement that the video streaming offers, and they also joined the media and entertainment industry. And now with the newest developments due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the number of media companies that have started with video streaming has increased even more than before, thus making this trend the most remarkable of all.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, in the end, the video steaming companies that will be most successful in this industry will be those that offer the best content libraries that will satisfy the user’s expectations. In addition to video, companies that include music and games in their libraries will have a higher probability of succeeding in the media and entertainment industry in the new decade. </p>

<h2><strong>5G Network</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">2020 brought changes in the telecom industry by introducing the 5G wireless network. Although there have been many controversies about whether 5G is good or bad for the people, it is inevitable that it will not only affect telecom operators but it will also make a change in the experiences that will facilitate faster broadband. The development of 5G may contribute to evolving the purpose of content in general. Thanks to the evolution of 5G, both artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) have also marked advancement in the media and entertainment industry. </p>

<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Artificial Intelligence has marked the last decade with its increasing dominance in the tech world. It has been used for the improvement of the customer experience and numerous other business operations. Starting with 2020 and onward, AI will continue dominating the media and entertainment industry, especially because the media companies will want to use AI for personalized content recommendations and adequate advertisements. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With the help of AI, media and entertainment companies are able to discover user behavior patterns and know what type of ads to show them. Furthermore, businesses and online creators who use AI learn user behavior better and know how to create more efficient content and advertisements. In addition to AI, the other two technologies that help businesses get closer to their customers are machine learning and big data technology.</p>

<h2><strong>Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR)</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another trend in the media and entertainment industry for 2020 is the further development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). While VR has higher applicability in the entertainment industry, AR is trending in the gaming industry. However, VR is a technology for creating 3D games, along with the help of biosensors which determine the position of players in the 3D space. It also helps in the creation of virtual museums, theatres, galleries, and parks. The latest trend in VR and AR will continue developing in the decade that has just begun and it will provide the possibility of viewing 3D images with real size in front of you. Businesses are slowly adapting to the implementation of VR and AR in their companies so that they can meet the needs of their customers and challenge their competitors. </p>

<h2>How COVID-19 Will Affect the Media and Entertainment Industry Trends for 2020</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With the current Coronavirus pandemic situation, the media and entertainment industry may develop at a more rapid speed, especially because staying at home means using the media more than usual. While many entertainment places closed during this period (such as theatres, cinemas, museums, parks, concert halls), online types of entertainment gained a lot of income. As mentioned before, the development of VR and AR helps in the creation of virtual museums, theatres, cinemas, parks, and galleries, which will try and compensate for the closure of the actual and real entertainment places. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, although the development of the online media and entertainment industry is on the rise, the production of movies will lose billions of dollars and this may be the end of the movie-making era if there is no cure for the Coronavirus soon. Therefore, we must have in mind the advantages and the disadvantages of this situation and how it will affect both the media and the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the end, living our lives online is possible up to some point. However, we cannot depend entirely on the creation of virtual worlds, when we are real human beings that have the need for personal life experiences in the actual world. Therefore, we need to adapt both the media and entertainment industry to the current trends and at the same time try and find a way to help it continue developing offline as much as online. It is left to us to witness what the following months will bring. But one thing is for sure: the media and entertainment trends will stay intact and the industry will continue adapting to changes.</p>

<h2 id="qualitycontent"><strong>Create Quality Content</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One way to grow your business online is to create high-quality content that your customers will enjoy. Your consumer interacts with your content. Your content includes your services or product description, the information you present about your business to the customers, and much more. If the content is engaging, the customers will have a reason to stay with you and eventually accept what you offer. Your website needs to be fast for your audience not to get fed up with it. Also, as part of your content, you need to watch out for aesthetics and your design layout. Make use of the right color, graphics, even a whole layout. All of these have a tremendous impact on your website’s content and look. </p>

<h2 id="mobilefriendlywebsite"><strong>Invest in a Mobile-Friendly Website</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As we have mentioned earlier, no one has the luxury of space to move everywhere with their PC or laptop. The presence of tablets and smartphones has made online surfing easy. Thus, your website should be easy to navigate, and it should be mobile-friendly such that your potential customers will not feel uncomfortable while they browse around your online store. Making your website mobile-friendly involves making sure that there is no flash video, that the photos are well optimized, the website is easy to navigate, and that there are elements that will get you to other activities with just one tap. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Social media is one of the most useful resources you can use to grow your online business, especially now. There are millions of people on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and many other social media platforms. Among these millions of people, you have your potential customers that see what you have to offer them. Making use of social media requires you to engage in some activities such as posting every day, including images, videos, and text to pass across relevant information, so eventually, they’ll be excited to check your website. To do these, you need a couple of resources,<strong> </strong>which we will discuss during your<strong> <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/hire-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">scheduled free consultation</a>. </strong></p>

These resources will help you identify the right set of audience for your business and earn you a significant profit with fewer expenses. <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/hire-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Schedule your free consultation here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="adaptable"><strong>Be Adaptable</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Be ready to diversify. Follow the online trends and keep your business growing. Daily, new trends are being posted online and they are crucial to digital businesses’ health. Keep up with the updates to be aware of the exact trend that is ongoing so your business can benefit from it. This may mean you need to add more advert to your business, or you need to expand your inventory. It also can mean that you need to start using a YouTube channel. We also consult using specific resources that will help you identify the trends online that you can utilize to grow your digital business.</p>

<h2 id="buildnetwork"><strong>Build a Network with Complementary Businesses</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Start networking with other businesses online. When you set up relationships with other businesses, it will bring your business closer to those who are not aware of it. The key here is your network. It is great as it gives you the opportunity to expand your business on the wings of the big companies. An example of this is Cosmic Development. 95% of our clients come as referrals, and most of them were once startups, now grown into large scale businesses. We could help you connect and identify such an opportunity to grow your business in the online market. </p>

<h4><strong>How and when did your Cosmic journey begin? What was the one thing that convinced you to choose our company?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My Cosmic journey began eight years ago, back in 2012. I was 22 years old, a young spirit with a desire to learn and advance in my career. Cosmic Development was considered as a leader in the IT industry on our territory. After I did my research for the company, I was sure that I had a million reasons to apply for this company and no reason to give up. I must admit that it wasn't easy but I managed to achieve success! Today I can say that I am proud to be part of the Cosmic family and if I am given another chance to make that decision, I will definitely choose Cosmic Development all over again!</p>

<h4><strong>Before working as an Office Manager at Cosmic, you were the company’s secretary. Tell us more about the possibilities for work advancements that Cosmic offers to its employees?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development offers great opportunities for career advancement and it tends to follow the theory that puts the "Employee in the first place". This implies a commitment of the employees to their professional development by constantly transferring knowledge and improving skills. For that purpose, Cosmic Development always invests in employees and enables them to attend conferences and training, and obtain certifications that will definitely improve their work in the long term.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As an Office Manager of the Cosmic’s office in Skopje, I am responsible for various aspects. Each of those aspects has its own priorities and expectations. The biggest challenge of all is taking care of the entire office. Every day is different and dynamic and brings new tasks constantly. Each new task is a challenge you need to master in order to move forward with the job responsibilities.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Everyone wants to be successful in their job while also having a good relationship with their own colleagues and the employer. It is a juncture of various ideals that you need to have if you want to be known as a successful employee. However, the most important thing is to have a desire for work, to be responsible, dedicated, and persistent in the job you do.</p>

<h4><strong>In a time of the current Coronavirus pandemic outbreak, how do you manage to get your work done on time?&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working during a pandemic outbreak such as the one caused by the current Coronavirus is definitely not an easy task. Due to the situation at hand, the biggest advantage is to work with a top team which makes tasks easier and simpler. The privilege to work from home is not something new in our company. Cosmic Development has always allowed flexibility to its employees, so we have adapted quickly and successfully. Thanks to the flexibility we have, the work commitments are executed on time and all obligations are completed temporarily and successfully.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The entertainment part is always welcome in our offices because the circle of great colleagues always motivates me to have a lot more fun than I imagined. One of the most important fun activities organized by Cosmic Development is the annual Team Building. This is an event where employees from all of the Cosmic offices around the world come together in one location and spend time together as one big family. The preparation for this event has always been in my hands and it has been a great challenge as well, but the successful implementation of the team building event is what also has helped me grow on a professional level.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As my greatest professional achievement in Cosmic Development, I consider the past eight years dedicated to this company and all the friends I gained throughout those years and the unforgettable moments I spent with them. However, when talking about my favorite personal achievement outside of work, I can say that it cannot be measured by money and praise, because in a short time for the first time I will become a mother, and that is a prestige that nothing can replace. :)</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Content marketing is a highly effective, scalable, and affordable way to generate strong leads for your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="B2B marketing strategy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-build-a-strong-b2b-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank">B2B marketing strategy</a> consistently. Today, more than ever, during this COVID-19 situation, your clients and your leads want to feel that you care about them and that you are willing to provide additional value to their business. The impact of social isolation and the increase of many ongoing news and distractions in today’s everyday life make the attention span even lower. It makes this period to be even more challenging. The pressure is real, and the success of your company’s content depends on how much value that content will provide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Producing content that is engaging is a constant challenge. Content marketing is not as simple as it might seem, and there are many challenges that B2B marketers face. Some of the key challenges are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Producing engaging content</li><li>Producing consistent content&nbsp;</li><li>Measuring content effectiveness&nbsp;</li><li>Producing content from experts</li><li>Lack of Budget</li><li>Having Skilled Content Marketing Professionals&nbsp;</li><li>Lack of Marketing Integration </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When we say content marketing, we suggest creating and sharing content in various formats that provide value to your target market and get your clients to act or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/free-it-consultation-during-coronavirus/" target="_blank">schedule a free consultancy</a> to get more insights. The most used B2B content marketing tactics are social media content articles, eNewsletters, articles on your website, blogs, case studies, videos, illustrations, photos, white papers, infographics, research reports, microsites, e-books, mobile apps, in-person events, online presentations, webinars/webcasts, conferences, podcasts, games and gamification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are many options for using suitable tactic depending on what your business does, but here is a list we think is a must-have content variety you need to offer your potential leads:</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="blogs"><strong>Blogs</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first step of the content marketing strategy is to have valuable articles on your blog. If your company already has a vast range of blogs that trigger curiosity and solve problems for your clients, you need to make analysis in your social media pages and within your company’s <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-google-analytics-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Google Analytics </a>account. To have result-driven content, you need to analyze your buyer personas - your targeted audience profiles and, more specifically, their pain points and challenges. You need to know what they’re struggling with and write your blog content around while experimenting with the content proven to be popular and trendy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first step in creating relevant B2B blog posts for your audience is to target the posts with the client’s main points and offer solutions on how to solve their challenges. If you seek a faster and easier way to do this, the only way is with outsourcing expertise. There are many <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/first-hand-reasons-why-outsourcing-content-creators-is-the-right-way-to-go/" target="_blank">reasons why outsourcing content writing is the right solution</a>.

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="ebooks"><strong>eBooks</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">B2B eBooks are one of the most cost-effective content marketing strategies because they are jam-packed with information, valuable to the audience, and able to collect or convert potential customer information if you decide to use them as a lead magnet. In many cases, buyers are willing to register and share information about themselves in return for eBooks. In other words, this means that your company could get a leg-up on lead generation with eBooks, and that’s why you need to include them into your editorial calendar content list.</p>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="research"><strong>Research</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you are striving to create B2B content marketing that gets backlinks and improves overall SEO (Search Engine Optimization), original research is another must-have in your editorial calendar content list. This is because people–writers want to back up their content with statistics. By collecting your statistics and running a survey or analyzing the results you’ve brought to your clients, you will result in tons of industry authority and backlinks–a key ranking factor in the search algorithms.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="videos"><strong>Video</strong>s</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The B2B video content marketing needs to be precisely what your audience wants to watch. In the beginning, you need to follow your Google Analytics reports and get to know what kind of blog content brings you the most traffic, whether it turns your traffic into leads and if not seize the data and use it as action steps accordingly. A good idea for this is to promote your current blog content with solutions in a visual and more appealing way.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="casestudies"><strong>Case Studies</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Most of the B2B tech buyers search for peer reviews and testimonials before purchasing. We advise and suggest to you, in the beginning, to create a few case studies on the growth of your biggest clients, starting with what kind of problem your clients had, what did they ask you to do, what kind of solution did your company suggest, and the results your company delivered. Actionable case studies will prove to your potential clients that your service works. You would be giving them data to show it in real-life while you tie in a success story from your existing clients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="reports"><strong>Reports</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One other way to bring value is with free downloadable research included in a report file. Reports are part of content marketing but are time-consuming which is valuable as it serves the clients with up-to-date research data on the topics that they find useful for their business. For the current clients, it is great to send this in an email Newsletter, and for the potential clients, it can be a great lead generation source on your website. Research and reports as content writing build trust, as it educates your clients and provides valuable insights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="cta"><strong>CTA (Call to Action)</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you already have valuable content, our next step is to include a call to action or CTA. A good content marketing needs to level up your lead generation. The call to action should be:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Action-oriented</li><li>Used in first-person&nbsp;</li><li>Contain strong visuals</li><li>Have a sense of urgency</li><li>Eliminate friction objectives&nbsp;</li><li>Stand out and be easy to find</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For every call to action to generate leads, you also need to remember your buyer’s journey. If the call to action you add does not fulfill the need of your potential client at the specific point in their journey they will be encountering it, it is not going to resonate with them, and they are not likely to move forward. There are many varieties of designs you can use when altering your Calls To Action with (and not limited to): color, button shape and size, size, style, position (both on the web page and the website), and animations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When creating your call to action, you need to make sure that the CTA is important enough to attract potential clients. This can be created by utilizing a contrasting color from your website, a bright and robust font, specific placement, and actionable content. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Witnessing the rise of Python, we can't help but notice its implementation in almost every aspect of our lives. From its general purpose for developing GUI applications, web applications, and websites, to its core functionality, which is to take care of the common programming tasks, Python is certainly classified as a high-level programming language. With that being said, Python has a simple syntax that makes the code base readable and maintainable. There are many other </em><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/advantages-of-using-the-python-programming-language-in-the-new-decade/"><em>advantages of using Python</em></a><em>, especially its easy-to-use feature that separates it from other programming languages. <br></em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>In this article, </em><strong><em>Nikola Dokoski</em></strong><em> covers a few methods for automatically sending email messages using Django. His basic idea is to create a Django project where he will present a model for holding scheduled mail, add a management command to send scheduled emails manually, and finally cover a few methods to automate this process.<br></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Nikola will explain the entire process - if you are interested in the main bits of code as well as a </em><code><em>`tar.gz`</em></code><em> that you can install via pip, just scroll to the end.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Let's start off with some basic stuff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I will be using a virtualenv for this article. I recommend that you use it too - you can install it via <code>`pip install virtualenv`</code> and check out the docs at <code>https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/1.7.1.2/</code></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Create a venv and install Django:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install django # At the time of writing, I am using django 3.0.6.</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Then we create the project and the app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>django-admin startproject auto_mail
cd auto_mail
python manage.py migrate # For default models - users and whatnot.
python manage.py startapp mail_app</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We won't really be creating any views and URLs here - we will just use the models, admin, and management modules. This makes the app easier to use and to add to other projects.<br>On that end, we want a model for a scheduled mail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># in mail_app/models.py

class MailAttachment(models.Model):
	attachment_file = models.FileField()
	attached_to = models.ForeignKey('ScheduledMail', related_name = 'attachments', on_delete = models.CASCADE)

	def __str__(self):
    	return '%s (%s)' % (self.attachment_file.filename, self.attached_to.subject)


class MailRecipient(models.Model):
	mail_address = models.CharField(max_length = 40)

	def __str__(self):
    	return self.mail_address


class ScheduledMail(models.Model):
	subject = models.CharField(max_length = 40)
	template = models.FileField(upload_to = 'mail_app/mails')
	send_on = models.DateTimeField(default = timezone.now())
	recipients_list = models.ManyToManyField(MailRecipient, related_name = 'mail_list')

	def __str__(self):
    	return self.subject</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Fairly simple. We have a ScheduledMail model, which is the basis for this app that holds a subject and a template. We have the template as a file because, well, we may want our mail to be formatted nicely as an HTML message. If we were to use a standard CharField, it would have to be with a really high max length, which is not the best for use in a database, so way better is to just upload files. Furthermore, we can create a better method of creating mails via a view, as well as preview and whatnot, then save it to a file and upload it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The other models – MailAttachment and MailRecipient – will allow us to add multiple users and attachments to our mail messages. With that, we have most of what our app will be using! We just need to write a management command.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before we do that though, let’s create the database. For development, I just go with sqlite3, as it’s easy to backup and play around with. You might want to use PostgreSQL or something heavier for production. So, let us add our app in the project settings, under INSTALLED_APPS. Also, since we are using a FileField for our mail template, we also need to define MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL values so that our files can be uploaded properly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># in auto_mail/settings.py
...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
	'django.contrib.admin',
	'django.contrib.auth',
	'django.contrib.contenttypes',
	'django.contrib.sessions',
	'django.contrib.messages',
	'django.contrib.staticfiles',
	'mail_app',
]

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = 'media/'</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And now we can migrate:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One last step before finally viewing the admin - registering the models. Add this to your app's admin.py folder:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># in auto_mail/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import ScheduledMail, MailAttachment, MailRecipient

# Register your models here.

@admin.register(ScheduledMail)
class MailAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	pass

@admin.register(MailAttachment)
class AttachmentAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	pass

@admin.register(MailRecipient)
class RecipientAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	pass</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And finally, create a superuser and run the server:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Great, we have our models, we can add mails, add recipients, and so on. Let's create the actual command. And, well, it's pretty simple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>mkdir -p mail_app/management/commands
touch mail_app/management/commands/__init__.py
touch mail_app/management/__init__.py</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After this, we just need to add our send mail command in that folder. To keep the code clean, let us add all mail functionalities in the models themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># in mail_app/models.py

from django.conf import settings

auto_mail_from = 'from@mail.com'
if hasattr(settings, 'AUTO_MAIL_FROM'):
	auto_mail_from = settings.auto_mail_from

class ScheduledMail(models.Model):


        ...
	@classmethod
	def get_today_mail(cls):
    	today = date.today()
    	return cls.objects.filter(send_on__year = today.year, send_on__month = today.month, send_on__day = today.day)

	def send_scheduled_mail(self):
    	message = self.template.read().decode('utf-8')
    	recipient_list = list(self.recipients_list.values_list('mail_address', flat = True))
    	mail_msg = EmailMessage(
        	subject = self.subject,
        	body = message,
        	from_email = settings.AUTO_MAIL_FROM,
        	to = recipient_list,
    	)
    	mail_msg.content_subtype = 'html'

    	mail_msg.send()</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Then we can use these methods in the management command.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># in mail_app/management/commands/send_scheduled_mails.py

from datetime import date

from django.core.management import BaseCommand

from mail_app.models import ScheduledMail

class Command(BaseCommand):
	help = 'Sends an email to any client for which a discount has started today.'

	def handle(self, *args, **options):
    	today_mail = ScheduledMail.get_today_mail()
    	for mail_message in today_mail:
        	mail_message.send_scheduled_mail()</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here, to define the from_email argument, we have added value in settings.py. This makes it a bit more modular, but you should then add this variable to the settings file. If not, you can just hardcode a string here. While we’re editing settings though, let’s also add some email parameters. For now, we will just use the file-based email backend so we can test the app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># in settings.py

...
# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/static-files/

STATIC_URL = '/static/'


# AUTO_MAIL stuff
# it doesn't actually matter where this is

EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_FILE_PATH = '/tmp/app-messages' # change this to a proper location

AUTO_MAIL_FROM = 'some_mail@mail.com'</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Neat! Let's try it out (you might have to add some objects in admin for it to work)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And ta-da! We can send mail via a simple command. This is not the final product yet though – we will add a bunch of quality of life additions later on (such as a few options when selecting recipients for a new mail, variables within the mail message and so on).<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before we do that though, we have a couple of things to finish off. First off - the automation. Sending mail via commands is cool, but we can set it up so it's all automatic.<br>Enter Cron. Cron is extremely basic, it's great for making quick and dirty projects, or demonstrating how to automate something.<br>Just add this to your crontab:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>0 0 * * * cd /path/to/your/project/root/ &amp;&amp; /path/to/your/venv/bin/python3.6 manage.py send_scheduled_mails</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can change the minutes and hour values (the first two zeroes) to whatever the current time is + a few minutes, and see if you get anything new in django_mail/. If it doesn't work, check if your paths are correct by executing the command you paster in crontab from your home directory. If there are errors, you can usually find them in /var/log/syslog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And as far as automation goes, this is enough. In a more serious project, however, you may want to use Celery, which comes included in the project and will spare you from messing with Cron. Celery is its own beast though, and there's little point in writing a tutorial on how to write a celery app when the celery website has its own tutorial, so you might want to check that out at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="First Steps with Celery (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html" target="_blank">First Steps with Celery</a>  and then later on <a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/django/first-steps-with-django.html">First Steps with Django</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":25} -->
<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Then, there is one last thing to do - actually, send emails. So far we've only been saving them in files, but in real life, we want to send real messages, This might be a bit tricky and may involve several other technologies that are out of the scope of this tutorial. If you want to accomplish this, there are a few methods you can think about:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Host your own mail server. If you are doing this as a side project, proof of concept or just messing around, this is probably the way to do it. I recommend either using virtual machines or containers, but the easiest way is to probably use a web solution and just run an AWS or GCE instance.</li><li>Use an existing mail server. Gmail, Mailgun, Amazon SES, etc. There's a bunch of these, some free, some paid, but in general, you can configure your settings to use a mail server.</li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can use the management command as described above. In order to do so, however, you still have to add it to INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.py file, as well as define MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL settings values.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In an uncertain time and economy when every cent counts, even the smallest income in profit can impact the overall business profitability. The good news is that smaller steps and cuts usually bring a more significant effect. It is often uncomplicated, common-sense steps that improve the bottom line, especially for a small business.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cut costs and save money on office supplies by contacting distributors to let them know you are price shopping. Never settle with the distributors you already have and keep checking for offers from other distributors outside your current ones. Usually, the newer and smaller distributors provide better value and service as they are in the beginning, and they will strive to be more flexible and thus help you cut costs. Plan wisely, buy supplies once in a month or in bulk. And remember that buying bigger supplies will help you save money and cut delivery costs.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a startup or company owner, you need to look for ways to cut operational costs and optimize resources. Here are our few suggestions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Resell the old equipment or consider other ways to use your waste to create another product or donate these to people or other companies in need.</li><li>Rent the free space to another startup, digital nomad, or freelancer. You can rent one room, an entire office, or storage space.</li><li>Follow and measure the operational efficiency of your startup or business to see the reduction effects and optimize your available resources. Track your performance parameters and see how they reflect your efficiency goals and offer incentives when you meet those goals.</li><li>Have energy-efficient appliances. Turn off lights and unplug unused tech.</li><li>Encourage telecommunications and work from home days.</li><li>Go paperless, save nature and the trees and also cut costs.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Check your insurance policies if you want to lower your financial expenditures. Also, check your financial accounts in order to find places where you can save money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Compare the competitive rates of all providers in order to save money on insurance. Then, ask your current insurance provider or lender to match the most competitive rate of all.</li><li>Combine your insurance policies or bank accounts.</li><li>Evaluate your insurance policies in order to ensure that you are not over-insured or that you do not have duplicate coverage.</li><li>Do not accept any unnecessary debt. Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis and make a future forecasting when considering the option for business expansion. Take into consideration all the opportunity costs and the entire effect of debt payments on cash flow. A surplus of debt affects company rating, interest rates, and the ability to borrow in the future.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The social media networks nowadays offer cheaper alternatives for reaching more specific and targeted leads and clients. Instead of spending on traditional TV commercials and billboards, with SEO and <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-use-content-marketing-in-your-b2b-lead-generation-strategy/">excellent content marketing</a>, you can seize the search engines and generate traffic to your website and increase awareness about your startup or business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Linkedin, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, and website articles and blogs are critical in lead generation and finding new potential clients. Study your buyer personas, target market and discover what will be a better method for reaching your targeted demographic, which social media channels are better to use, and how you can achieve them in the most efficient cost-savvy way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-send-scheduled-emails-with-the-programming-language-python/">Build a customer e-mailing</a> list and a referral program. A client recommendation is far more likely to result in a sale than traditional marketing.</li><li>Facilitate word of mouth marketing, use networking more, and advertise less. Clients are more likely to close a deal with a business or someone they recognize. Check the existing groups on Linkedin and Facebook. Make sure you provide valuable comments and recommendations to everyone in need, build up a community, and seize the contacts as future potential clients.</li><li>Reduce marketing costs by having in-house marketers and do not hesitate to outsource when needed.</li><li>Partner with other companies, organizations, and get sponsors for your networking events.</li><li>Use social media instead of traditional marketing for better tracking and better results.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Optimization of employee productivity cuts your costs of doing business. Time is also a cost and money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Limit access to time wasters and other distractions. Propose usage of platforms and applications that help your teammates and employees to focus and concentrate on staying on track with their tasks.</li><li>See where your employees or teammates spend the most time and dedicate a reasonable time to complete specific actions and functions. Help your team and offer your support if you see that there are tasks which consume more time.</li><li>Schedule each activity and encourage your employees to update their schedules daily and weekly.</li><li>Schedule a meeting only when needed. Make it clear that you respect everyone's time and ask everyone to be on time, each session to have a plan and everyone to follow up at the appointed time.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Set up an option for a virtual office.</li><li>Online meetings help minimize travel costs, and virtual offices can eliminate the need for physical space. While we certainly don't want to remove personal contact, save it for the instances when it's most beneficial.</li><li>Use the free storage cloud services.

<h3 id="narrowyourfocus"><strong>7. Narrow Your Focus</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a startup or a business owner, try narrowing your business focus as it turns out to be the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-scale-a-business/">most effective strategy for improving</a> these situations. Limit the services you offer and the projects you accept, and you'll see that you'll be more efficient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another different way to adhere to your business focus is to subcontract. Rather than turn away business, maximize your capacity by outsourcing services whenever possible. More projects provide more revenue increase, while subcontracting equals lower expenses and saves you time and effort. The result is a better profit.</p>

<h3 id="useyourofficespacemoreefficiently"><strong>8. Use Your Office Space More Efficiently</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Analyze how you are using your current physical office. Do you maybe have storage with many supplies, piles of paper files, and inefficient furniture or computer equipment that can be resold or used for a different purpose?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">See if you can consolidate different functions or departments of your business into one. Use employees and office space for more positions, projects, or clients if you see they could use more experience and have free time. A conference, office, or meeting room that can be used as a rest or playroom is good to be checked. The opportunities depend on the nature of your business or startup.</p>

<h3 id="useyouremployeesskills"><strong>9. Use Your Employees' Skills</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your Human Resources department needs to have stay-in interviews for regular check-ups and tracking the employee career development and every new skill, training, and certification they will get. See how your company is using your employee's experience, competence, and technical and soft skills and reevaluate if you could use them better based on your employee career preferences and future growth. Be open for inputs and give responsibilities to the employees with the most competence and efficiency in those areas. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Do not use expert salespeople for writing articles, placing Excel "numbers" or design tasks. Although one person must be skillful for a variety of functions, consider exchanging some of the functions with someone who is a better fit for those tasks and needs less time in doing those tasks with efficiency. If you don't have the right HR department, you can always <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/hire-us/">outsource</a> this, and you will see how useful it is.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working as a Content Editor requires choosing the best ideas that the audience will like to spend time on. Finding the right way of promoting your content in order to attract more traffic is definitely not an easy job. However, when you have on your team a loyal and dedicated Content Editor with more than seven years of experience, you know that success is inevitable. For <a href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Rumble</a>, that experienced content editor is Nick Naumoff - a valuable asset to both the Rumble team and the Cosmic family. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Nick has begun his career as a Content Manager who was of great help in the launch of Rumble back in 2013. He witnessed the rise of Rumble from its start until what it has become nowadays - a popular video content platform. Therefore, we decided to ask him to share his experience and his personal career development path within Rumble. We were curious about Nick’s beginnings at Cosmic Development, his key turning points in the career development and how he upgraded along the way. Continue reading the interview below if you want to know more about the several steps that each Content Editor must take in order to convert the best ideas into qualitative content.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Knowing that you have been with Cosmic Development for a long time, could you tell us when exactly did you join the Cosmic family and how did that happen?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I joined Cosmic in October of 2013 a few weeks before one of today’s most popular video content platforms - Rumble - went live. Prior to my employment in Cosmic Development, I had taken part in several networking events. Through those events, I had met <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-video-content-brought-success-to-rumble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Chris Pavlovski</a>, the founder and CEO of Rumble and founder of Cosmic, as well as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Ryan Milnes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Ryan Milnes</a>, the CEO of Cosmic Development. This happened at the perfect time when they were looking for English native speakers to help bring Rumble to life. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">From Nick's personal experience, conferences and networking events can prove to be highly beneficial for your career advancement. If you are wondering why you should go to a conference, read our article on the topic: <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/conference-and-networking-event-should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Conference and Networking Events: Should I Stay or Should I Go?</a> and let us help you answer that question.</p>

<h3>What was your role when you first started working for Rumble as one of Cosmic’s clients?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I first started working for Rumble, they were about to go live and they needed help to activate. Therefore, my first and main role was to help activate and post to Rumble’s social media pages. In addition, I also helped with finding and recruiting videos to the Rumble platform.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Could you explain in further detail the responsibilities that you had as a Content Manager? How did you determine which content is good for publishing?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a Content Manager, you have several filters to help you determine the best content to publish on Rumble. The first is to simply decide if the video is entertaining enough for as many people as possible to enjoy. Second, you can find where the video was originally posted in order to see how many views it had gotten and if it was gaining traction. The third filter is to find users that already have a large following, which helps ensure that the clip will do well. Using these three methods will almost always be beneficial for Rumble and its <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-video-content-brought-success-to-rumble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="video content creators (opens in a new tab)">video content creators</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>When did you make a switch from Content Manager to Editor and in what did your responsibilities differ? How did you plan and prioritize your work responsibilities?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After a few years working as Content Manager at Rumble, I was able to put my English skills to good use by assisting with catchy and creative titles and descriptions for our top tier videos. This was a great challenge for me because I needed to continually improve my creative skills in order to keep things new and fresh.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Could you describe some of the challenges that you faced throughout your entire career at Rumble?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The industry in the viral video market is constantly changing and is extremely competitive. Luckily, Chris, the CEO of Rumble, is an expert in this field. Through his guidance and insight as to what comes next, we are able to constantly change and adapt to the ever-changing video world. The challenge is to be able to learn quickly and often what content works best on which outlet in order to stay successful.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think that simply being with the company for this long is a great achievement on its own. To be honest, I am lucky enough to see Rumble from its birth to where it is now. I am even more excited to see how it will continue to develop and where it will go in the future. And throughout it all, Cosmic has been utterly fantastic.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What are Keywords and How to Conduct a Keyword Analysis?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer"><br/>Keywords, also known as 'Key Phrases' or 'Search Queries,' are the words that people enter in search engines when looking for something online. From the company's aspect, they are the ideas and topics that define your content's purpose. In terms of SEO, keywords are the words and phrases that searchers enter into search engines. Companies use strictly-defined keywords according to the products or services they offer so that their businesses may rank higher in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) when people search for those keywords. The main target of business owners is to use keywords on their websites that will bring them higher chances of getting more website traffic. For that purpose, content creators and SEO analysts will have to conduct keyword research to ensure that the keywords they will use on the website and blog are relevant and searched for. <br/><br/>Therefore, I can say that the most crucial part of these writing guidelines is to learn how to conduct a keyword analysis. Keywords are essential for creating an article. Keywords are important because they represent the connection between what people are searching for and the content that is written for that purpose. Moreover, they help in ranking higher on SERPs, thus driving organic traffic to your website. The keywords chosen by an SEO analyst will determine what kind of traffic you get. <br/><br/>Example:<em> If you are offering software development services, you may want to rank for "python programming language," - but if you're not careful, you may end up attracting traffic interested in the family of snakes - python. </em><br/><br/>Business owners usually want to have content that ranks well organically and drives visitors to their websites. However, they need first to understand their reader's language and the type of content they seek. They can do this by talking to the customers, by conducting keyword analysis, or by frequenting forums and community groups. Nowadays, there are various tools for conducting a keywords research. You can choose whichever suits your needs. The choices vary from browser extensions such as the <a aria-label="Keywords Everywhere (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://keywordseverywhere.com/" target="_blank">Keywords Everywhere</a> and Google's product <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Keyword Planner (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_cy/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank">Keyword Planner</a> to SEO software such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://moz.com/" target="_blank">Moz</a>, digital marketing toolkit such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.semrush.com/" target="_blank">SEMRush</a>, and start-up companies that offer marketing tools such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank">Ahrefs</a>. <br/><br/><img alt="Writing Guidelines for blog posts " src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/computer-pc-workplace-home-office-159760.jpg"/><br/><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-with-grey-ring-using-macbook-pro-159760/" target="_blank">Image source</a></p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><br/><strong>What is a Meta Title?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer"><br/>The meta title is, in fact, the title of the HTML document.

Meta titles describe the article's purpose and inform Google of that purpose. <br/><br/>Ideally, meta titles should be between <strong>50</strong> and <strong>67</strong> characters (<strong>580</strong> pixels long) and concisely explain a specific topic or phrase.

Every meta title must contain a major keyword; however, it must not contain any periods. <br/></p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><br/><strong>What is a Meta Description?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer"><br/>Meta descriptions explain the functions and the purpose of the page shown, and it is displayed immediately below the Meta Title on a SERP. The main focus of the meta description is to contain concise and thorough sentences that will make an emotional impact on the readers, thus enhancing the user experience. Meta descriptions must contain action words that may vary based on what the users will find on the page. If the page is informational, point out the information that they will read.<br/><br/>Meta descriptions should contain from one to three keywords, depending on the length of the keyword itself. When creating a meta description, you should already have a list of keywords that you will use throughout the article. Think of keywords that people mostly search for. If possible, make sure to add keywords to the beginning of the phrases in the meta description.<br/><br/>Meta descriptions must be between <strong>120-158</strong> characters. Try not to go over <strong>158</strong> characters (<strong>919</strong> pixels long); otherwise, you run the risk that Google cuts the description off. Unlike meta titles, the meta descriptions contain sentences, so you need to add a period at the end of each sentence.<br/><br/><img alt="Examples of meta title and description as part of the writing guidelines" src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Meta-title-and-meta-description-1.jpg"/><br/>This is an example of a meta title and a meta description. The meta title consists of the page title <em>"About Us | IT Support Services Company"</em>, followed by a vertical bar <em>(|)</em> and the name of the company <em>"Cosmic Development"</em>:<br/><strong><em>About Us | IT Support Services Company | Cosmic Development<br/></em></strong><br/>The meta description is the text below the meta title:<br/><em><strong>Learn more about Cosmic Development and the IT support services we offer. Discover our story and meet the team that motivates our people. </strong></em><br/><br/>The main keyword used in both the meta title and the meta description is:  <em><strong>IT support services</strong></em>  </p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><br/><strong>What are the Basic Rules for Writing a Blog?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer"><br/><br/><strong>Blog Post Length<br/></strong>We are aware that nowadays, people's attention span is several seconds and that no one wants to read long blog articles. However, the blog post length is one of the essential writing guidelines for a successful blog article. Google usually prefers longer articles that contain relevant keywords according to the article's topic. It is a general rule that longer posts tend to rank better because they cover the issue more thoroughly, and Google considers these articles as expert articles. Therefore, the ideal blog post length would be above 2,000 words. Those articles should usually be from five to seven minutes of reading time. <br/><br/>Furthermore, when considering the blog post length, you also need to have in mind the readers and not only the search engines. After all, you are also writing for the readers, not for the search engines alone. After conducting thorough research of your blog audience, you will be able to determine the length of your blog posts. However, the articles should not contain less than 1,000 words, which is approximately a post of three minutes of reading time. Besides, keep in mind that the blog post length is also dependent on the keywords you choose for the article. <br/><br/><strong>Language Usage<br/></strong>When writing a blog article, you should use plain English language, which will be equally understood by both native and non-native readers. Make sure that you blend the tenses wisely and that you mostly use the present tense. Moreover, make paragraphs short and break them up with lists, bullet points, and subheadings. Use collective nouns and avoid writing in the first person singular, because it is considered as informal. Try to use the third person when writing articles, to avoid informal texts. Both second and third persons are acceptable voices, so long as you are consistent with it in a given sentence or paragraph. <br/><br/>Furthermore, make sure that you avoid fluffy writing when creating your blog article. Fluffy writing is actually writing that is done simply to reach the word count. Every paragraph that you have in your article should provide valuable information to the reader. No one wants to read articles written simply to meet the word count. Everything you write should provide useful information to the reader concisely and cleanly.<br/><br/><strong>Tone of Voice</strong><br/>The usage of active voice should be dominant in your blog articles, while you must avoid the passive voice. The article's tone should be direct and informative. A passive voice gives the idea that the writer is not sure about the content provided. Active voice, on the other hand, projects confidence and authority. When it comes to the tone of voice, there are seven rules that you should follow throughout all blog posts:<br/><em>Human, not impersonal<br/>Conversational and engaging <br/>Knowledgeable, not professorial<br/>Professional, not corporate<br/>Confident, not arrogant<br/>Straightforward, not rude<br/>Friendly, not colloquial </em><br/><br/><strong>Structure Tips</strong><br/>When writing a blog post, you need to pay attention to the beginning of the article. At first, you need to create a topic sentence that will serve as an opener of your article and will catch the reader's attention. Therefore, make sure to take your time when crafting this topic sentence. Secondly, you need to have an irresistible introduction to the article. You can start by creating an attention-grabbing hook, for instance, using a metaphor, asking a question, telling a story, using statistics or facts, etc. And finally, you must include the keywords that you chose for the article at hand. Make sure to place the keywords in the meta title, meta description, subheadings, image alt tags, and throughout the entire article.<br/><br/><strong>Pronoun Agreement</strong><br/>When writing blogs, content creators need to ensure that they have a pronoun agreement both within the sentence and within the paragraph. What does this mean? It means that if, for instance, you are writing in the third person singular, you need to continue using nouns of third-person singular throughout the entire paragraph. <br/><br/>Wrong: <em>"The applicant must apply to their office." "Applicant"</em> is a third-person singular noun. <em>"Their"</em> reflects a third-person plural noun. <br/>Correct: <em>"Applicants must apply to their office."</em> or <em>"The applicant must apply to his/her office."</em> <br/><br/>When writing official and expert articles, you should choose to avoid personalization (<em>he/she</em>). Therefore, it is better if we write persons in the plural. Moreover, make sure to use proper pronoun agreement with a collective noun. Since a collective noun (<em>the team, the agency, the department, the company,</em> etc.) represents a singular unit, a singular term must follow, not a plural one. <br/><br/>Wrong: <em>"To contact the department, call their number." </em><br/>Correct: <em>"To contact the department, call its number."</em></p> </div> </div>

<h3><strong>Important AP Style Writing Guidelines</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The AP (Associated Press) Style is a writing style that every journalist or content creator must know by heart. The Associated Press has published numerous editions of their AP Stylebook so far, abounding with writing guidelines that writers and editors must follow if they want to produce qualitative pieces of writing. Blog editors are encouraged to follow the AP Styleguide when it comes to online content. AP Style is used to format numbers, dates, addresses, and much more. Below are listed some of the most important writing guidelines according to the AP Stylebook:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Only use single spacing – Do not double-space after the end of a sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Be mindful of when to write out the number and when to use the digits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Write out numbers when they start the sentence unless it is a year date. Examples:&nbsp;<ul><li><em>Twenty-five years ago, shoulder pads were popular. </em>&nbsp;</li><li><em>2007 saw a quick resurgence of the trend. </em>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Write out numbers from one to nine. From 10 on, you use the digits. (11, 12, 134, 155)&nbsp;</li><li><em>Ages</em>: all ages should be written out in figures: <em>1 year old, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years of age, etc.&nbsp;</em></li><li>Write out percent. <em>Five percent chance of rain.</em>&nbsp;</li><li>It is not AM or pm. It is 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. (do not include the <em>:00 </em>— you only include real minutes, like in 7:21 a.m.)&nbsp;</li><li>Years: the 1960s, the 2000s (no apostrophes are necessary)&nbsp;</li><li>Use double quotation "marks", <em>not</em> single 'ones'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Prior to launching eCommerce websites or stores, business owners need to decide which online tool or software they will use. Being a business owner used to require a much more significant investment in upstart capital. The rise of online businesses and eCommerce, combined with the accessibility of tools and software such as Shopify, WordPress, and WooCommerce, has eased the entire process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although this eases the process, it doesn't mean that running a good eCommerce business is simple. You have to do proper research and put in the work required to get your new business off the ground and maintain it successfully. But if you have an excellent base, work ethic, and at least a small investment of money, you can build an eCommerce website with Shopify or WordPress and start selling.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We've explored several scenarios while working with our clients who wanted to sell through an eCommerce website. Before choosing what platform fits better for what you are selling, you might need to do research and see what other companies use when building their eCommerce websites. And what you will discover is that most of them use Shopify and WordPress themes to help their business stand out online.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">We have done quick research on both platforms and the key features they offer and why you should choose one of these over the other when building an eCommerce website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you are interested in getting a better answer of which platform will serve your business' needs best, you will discover the solution by the end of this article. Here is an overview of Shopify and WordPress:</p>

<h2>Why Use Shopify to Build Your eCommerce Website?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Shopify is a web application and platform <strong>explicitly designed</strong> to allow shop owners to build and launch their online store.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It gives a range of templates that can be personalized to fulfill small businesses' branding needs, and it provides options for both digital and physical goods to be sold on these platforms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of Shopify's key benefits is that users without any technical or design skills can create a store in a few steps with no need for a developer or coding. However, those who want to have more customized themes need to know that Shopify also offers options for editing the HTML and CSS for your eCommerce website. This enables business owners to customize their online stores more extensively, as long as they have the needed coding skills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Most of the time, the business owners of an online shop or eCommerce website have the following two options:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>A.</strong> The shop is fully optimized for mobile phones. Everything is clear and easy to navigate. You can easily find what you search for. The drop-down menu works correctly. They have the amount and size of what you are looking for. There is even an option to pick your color! Great. Next, you click the cart button, and because you can save all of your essential information on your mobile phone, you can purchase by the time they bring you a coffee. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Let's see the next scenario:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>B.</strong> The website has a bad user experience. It is not fully optimized for mobile phones, and it takes many clicks to end the purchase. The thing you want to buy is in stock, but when you try to add it to your cart, the website crashes. It would help if you zoomed in more to insert your credit card number manually.</p>

<h4>What do you think? Which scenario will work better?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These two scenarios happen often, and what is obvious is that scenario A will end with more sales. People want a fast, easy, and time-saving experience when buying something on the internet. The easy way to get to Scenario A is by coupling WordPress with Shopify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The success formula lies in getting the two platforms working together. Shopify has a design that eases the shopping experience with personalized customizable and responsive themes. Shopify offers themes that help the owner to see the look and feel of the store and website. It provides many possibilities for customization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The next good thing about Shopify is that it is battle-tested. They are reaching more than half a million users. There are many people already selling articles there. The owner or the seller might be good at designing cool stuff but lacks skills for marketing, payments, and secure checkouts, and Shopify helps a lot with this. And then there is everyone's favorite platform - WordPress. Shopify has created custom themes for everyone who loves and prefers WordPress. In combination, these two offer a safe shopping hosted and controlled on the shop owner's terms. Shopify included a built plugin to create pages or blog posts with a similar user experience from WordPress, where everything is managed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Shopify has partnered with Themezilla, Themify, and Ultralinx and has created three incredible themes specifically for WordPress users. Each item is made to modify the websites for either the hosted or self-hosted versions of WordPress.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Shopify eCommerce Plugin</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Once you pick a theme in Shopify, the next step is getting a Shopify Ecommerce Plugin, and you are ready to begin. Since the Plugin, the store and the owner's leading website are all connected - the owner and seller can drop products and buy buttons for consumers to take any action, anywhere, not just in the store they own. The links work on the eCommerce website's regular web pages, in a sidebar, or even on a splash page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">But here's a little hint: the Shopify Ecommerce Plugin works well on every WordPress theme. And even if the store and website are not connected directly, customers can find the store without any trouble.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Shopify is a service tool - which means that you need to have costs for a monthly fee to use it instead of owning it. Shopify is a web application that runs in the cloud, so as long as you are on the Internet and you have access to a web browser, you will be able to manage your online shop from anywhere in the world.</p>

<h2>Why Use WordPress to Build Your eCommerce Website?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">WordPress is stand-alone software that business owners need to install on their own and complete step-by-step instructions which take more time. Although WordPress has a lot of useful features, here we are focusing only on the role it has when building an eCommerce website. To discover more about the benefits of WordPress, check out our expert and leader in the WordPress community - <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/get-to-know-mile-milosheski-being-a-wordpress-expert-is-not-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Mile Milosheski</a> - and get advice directly from his personal experience. However, let us get back to the usage of WordPress when building an eCommerce website. There are two options when using WordPress:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Hosted WordPress</strong></li><li><strong>Self-hosted WordPress</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":25} -->
<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>Hosted WordPress</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The hosted WordPress is available at the WordPress site, and it is similar to Shopify as it is a software as a service tool. You need to pay a monthly fee, and then you get access to a range of features that enable you to create and maintain your website. It is less of an 'all-in-one' solution than Shopify; however, users need to use third-party tools like Ecwif and Woocommerce to add features for an eCommerce website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>Self-hosted WordPress</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The self-hosted WordPress, which owners need to self-host, is a part of the software that you can get from the leading WordPress site and install on your web server. It is open-source, meaning that the code behind it is available, and it is easily edited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Websites built with WordPress can be easily customized to many degrees. WordPress is a flexible tool that, in the hands of the right website developer, and with the right installed plugins, can help you adjust your website to meet the requirements of nearly any web design project.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The role of an HR manager is an essential aspect of every company, especially during difficult times, just as the one we are going through due to the Coronavirus. As we are aware, we already live in the 'new normal' time. In a very short period, the entire world was challenged by whether it can survive the new situation caused by COVID-19. This situation has affected the whole world economy, has brought <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/economic-crisis-and-recession-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="economic crisis and recession (opens in a new tab)">economic crisis and recession</a>, and has also influenced the human resources departments. The HR managers worldwide learned how to deal with the daily changes and took care of the employees' safety and health. Moreover, they were the main factor for maintaining an average level of mental health among the coworkers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The main focus throughout this period was to act rapidly and accordingly, get the employees engaged in work, detect any possible problems, find suitable communication channels, and ensure positive results by restructuring the companies. Therefore, the new situation required HR managers to connect more with the employees, listen to their needs, and react accordingly and empathically. The constant change caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has mandated that companies make fast changes in the leadership and engage the HR team in communication with the employees. This 'new normal' has taught us to adapt to new practices and politics, which will leave a permanent mark on companies worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Due to these current changes, we decided to interview our HR Manager Biljana Stefanovska and ask her how she deals with the 'new normal' aspect of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="working remotely (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/work-from-home-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank">working from home</a>.

<h4><strong>What is the role of the HR Manager in one company, and what are the necessary skills for an HR Manager to be successful?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Maybe the shortest and most straightforward definition of HR Manager is "mother of the company." As an HR manager, you take care of all employees, management, business, and everything in between. As of recently, the HR Management function has been slowly transforming into an HR business partner position. No person in the company knows the employees, the rulebook, or the management better than the HR manager. HR is everywhere, and with everyone, that is why crucial skills for an HR Manager are listening, empathy, objectivity, flexibility, tolerance, and an analytical mind. Modern HR is now more and more inclined towards metrics and predictions despite the simultaneous growth of importance and emphasis on the company's personal development: from the cleaning lady to the General Manager.</p>

<h4><strong>What are the challenges that an HR Manager faces during a pandemic, and how do you, as an HR manager, help Cosmic Development in overcoming these challenges?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the most important challenges for an HR manager during a pandemic is the employees' mental health and wellbeing. When I am present in the office, I can see and tackle every issue and mood swing of an employee, and I react immediately and accordingly to help this person. Given the fact that I have been an empathic person since I remember about myself, this has always been an easy task for me. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When we <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="work remotely (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-remote-working/" target="_blank">work remotely</a>, it takes an entirely different approach to notice the switch and even more to detect the severity of distress in someone's voice or facial expression. Yet, I am regularly contacting all employees, and we have personal coaching sessions so those who are most affected can overcome this situation. We also organized several activities for our employees under the name "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/cosmic-beats-isolation/" target="_blank">Cosmic Beats Isolation</a>" to help them deal better with the new situation. So far, our company has marked only success in every single case.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>What do you like most about Cosmic Development, and what makes this company unique from an HR perspective? How do you envision Cosmic in the upcoming years to become an ideal workplace?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">What makes Cosmic unique from an HR perspective is the holistic management approach and organizational culture. I do believe that holistic and agile management are the best practice since there are no two same human beings on earth. We organize team activities. We are continually working on enhancing the team spirit within the company while simultaneously keeping in mind the needs and preferences of each employee as an individual. It means we do have a set of rules necessary for the management of the company, yet we provide the employees with flexibility, allowing them to feel comfortable and with an excellent <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/guide-to-work-life-balance-for-web-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="work-life balance (opens in a new tab)">work-life balance</a>. I believe that we are already pretty close to an ideal workplace.</p>

<h4><strong>What are your favorite techniques that you usually suggest as an HR Manager, and you have used to motivate a team during this pandemic?&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As an HR Manager with ten years of experience, I can say there are no universal ways for motivating employees. Some people enjoy spending time by the swimming pool and working on their laptops surrounded by people and music, and others prefer solitude and tranquility. So, I do not practice a group approach to motivate them, but an individualistic one. Every HR Manager should spend time and understand each employee's needs, from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software developers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software developers</a> to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="administrative assistants (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/administration-and-virtual-assistance/" target="_blank">administrative assistants</a>. And when that is done, it is quite easy to motivate them. For those who like sports, we provide opportunities for sports breaks during working hours, for those who want leisure, we have comfortable couch areas so whoever may relax. And finally, for those who are ambitious and find new skills and career development as motivation, we provide free courses and training.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another unique feature of Cosmic Development is that we are a people-oriented company, which means we trust our employees and do not use tools for control. We follow their work, deadlines, and quality, but we do not need micromanagement tools and practices. When you have highly engaged people, you do not need to control them. The basic rule of HR is the following: <em>happy employees are equivalent to productive employees</em>. The more content the employee is, the more productive and efficient one is. My primary concern is whether all employees have everything they need to be productive at home. We have never had better efficiency actually, which I believe is due to the freedom everyone has to organize.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>How does this pandemic influence the HR team in the recruitment and the interviewing of prospective team members? Do you think that this virtual trial will continue to be the future of recruitment?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The only change in recruitment is that instead of conducting in-person interviews, we organize them online, which does not affect the recruitment process. The 'new normal' brought us changes in the working policy on a global level, and now the jobs are more and more conducted remotely since there are a lot of people who work and travel. I believe this will be the future: more remote work, higher work-life balance, individual approach.</p>

<h4><strong>What trends, according to you, will shape the Human Resource departments over the next five years?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I believe that the future of HR Management will focus more on analytics, predictions, risk management, training, and especially on leadership and coaching. We all live in an era when millennials are becoming the majority of the workforce. What distinguishes the millennials among the rest is constant engagement, dynamics, and continuant professional and personal development. It means we should not leave them alone; we should be constantly alert of their needs and changes and make them feel like we do care.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The dynamics of the labor market, especially in the IT industry, demands constant training and learning. I am more than happy that nowadays more and more emphasis is put on soft skills which were partly neglected until recently. Consequently, we must prepare the leadership for these changes to retain the concurrence on the market and keep the pace. Leadership is crucial in any business management, and nowadays, more and more companies are realizing that and investing in their leaders. Leaders, in my opinion, are the people who set the tone in any company. In the end, I would say that I am positive that HR Management will remain the most challenging occupation in the near future and, at the same time, most rewarding.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Want your business to succeed? Start practicing Emotional Intelligence</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional intelligence is an essential skill in every career, and people working in the sales department need it even more than others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Emotional intelligence is the ability to pay attention, monitor your emotions, influence, and understand other people's feelings.</li><li>Those who have high emotional intelligence do not allow their emotions to dictate their decisions or actions; instead, they recognize when it is time to manage the potentially evolving feelings.</li><li>Working on emotional intelligence skills can have a positive impact on your career, your private life, and your overall health.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are many things that are mandatory for a specific person to be an appropriate salesperson. Confidence, motivation, passion, and drive are all necessary, and the most crucial skill is the emotional intelligence.</p>

<h2>What Does Emotional Intelligence Mean?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional Intelligence is the skill to feel and manage emotions. The value of emotional intelligence in the workplace increases as people become more educated about stress management in the workplace and about the creation of an environment that marks mental health at work. Emotional Intelligence is a crucial factor in cultivating a healthy workplace.&nbsp;The five critical elements of emotional intelligence are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Self-awareness</li><li>Self-regulation</li><li>Motivation</li><li>Empathy</li><li>Social skills</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[4759],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/artificial-intelligence-3382507_960_720.jpg" alt="Emotional Intelligence and brain as AI" data-id="4759" class="wp-image-4759"/><figcaption><a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/artificial-intelligence-brain-think-3382507/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Emotional Intelligence Influence</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional Intelligence is a significant asset for every salesperson as it involves reading other people's feelings and having a better understanding of sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Managing Feedback</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional Intelligence is a real deal when handling feedback. Each potential client has different needs and concerns in the first stages of the funnel. Empathizing with customers and their needs, and being aware of their unique requirements makes the process easier. Every rejection is an opportunity, and if it is handled well with a newly presented opportunity, it might provide even more significant sales results.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p style="font-size:30px;text-align:center"><a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/free-it-consultation-during-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Schedule a free consultation with our experts</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Managing Rejections</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Every salesperson sees 'no' as an opportunity to do more or offer something better in the future and more valuable for the client. Seeing the rejections involves having a great understanding of emotional intelligence, and it is essential not to see the rejection personally but as a request for a future better proposal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center","customFontSize":30} -->
<p style="font-size:30px;text-align:center"><a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-manage-a-business-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/">Read more about how to manage a business during Coronavirus outbreak</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Building Rapport</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In business, every sales approach requests a different type of procedure. When the salesperson has excellent emotional intelligence, this is way easier. The method differs based on seeing how the other person likes to be treated. Sometimes a client would prefer to be addressed by title or informally by name. It is essential to see how the lead wants to be called so the salesperson could adapt and pitch accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Delayed Gratification</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Every salesperson is into closing a deal, but what differs a right salesperson from others is that they always prefer delayed gratification instead of instant gratification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>People with High EQ are also Great Managers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Having emotional intelligence and working in sales means having a mentally and emotionally stable personality. The sales industry is an adrenaline-driven profession, and sometimes if the team feels like celebrating, the manager needs to be aware and raise the spirit of the group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">An emotionally intelligent manager will always see the need when someone needs and wants to talk and balance the positivity and team spirit, which boosts the sales team's results. The natural ability to read emotions helps the manager to indulge in a closer relationship and creates a better working space for everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, if Jack has strengths in conflict management, he would be skilled in giving people unpleasant feedback. And if he were more inclined to influence, he would <em>want</em> to provide difficult feedback to lead his direct reports and help the results grow. For example, Jack has a colleague who is overwhelmed. Rather than smoothing the interaction, with emotional intelligence balance of EI skills, he could bring up the issue to his colleague drawing on emotional self-control to keep her reactivity at bay while telling the colleague what, individually, does not work in the way he wants—discussing issues to the surface tackle he core of conflict management. Jack can also draw on influence strategy to explain to his colleague that he wants to see the colleague succeed and that if he monitored how his style improves everyone around, he will understand better how he could help them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Similarly, if Jack has developed his managerial competence, he would be more successful at managing change. A manager with this strength can communicate a vision and mission that resonates emotionally with themselves and their teams, an essential ingredient in strategic management. Emotional Intelligence urges change and includes visionary leadership.</p>

<h2>Ways to Increase Emotional Intelligence (EI)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">EI is an essential skill that gets improved with time and with focused development on self-perception and self-awareness. It is a conscious choice of understanding and reading people needs, and there are several tips and tricks on how you can increase your emotional Intelligence:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Answer without reaction</strong>. It is widespread to feel anger and outbursts during conflict situations. People with higher emotional Intelligence can remain calm in the most stressful situations and do not make impulsive decisions. Emotional Intelligence helps in managing conflict and stressful situations.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Listen before acting</strong>. Listening is way more important than hearing. Managers with high emotional Intelligence first listen actively and carefully notice body language. They have a better understanding of what is being told before they act and see the nonverbal signs during the communication. This prevents misunderstandings, shows respect for the person talking, and allows the listener to respond appropriately.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Stay approachable and open</strong>. Be positive. Compliment your colleagues and clients. Radiate positive energy around you. Practice mindful management.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to See if You Have Improved in Emotional Intelligence?&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There is a 360-degree assessment, which collects both a self-rating and views of others who know you well. The external feedback is particularly helpful for evaluating all areas of emotional Intelligence, including self-perception and self-awareness, which helps you see how well self-aware you are. You will see where your strengths and weaknesses lie by asking those who work with you to provide you with feedback. The more answers you get from the input, the more precise picture you will get. The more significant the gap between a person's self-rating and how other people see them indicates how the EI status is.&nbsp;</p>

Shortly, you build more time to do proper research and develop your voice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Imagine being scrutinized by the world’s toughest content editor — you need all the help you can get to polish your writing and submit flawless drafts.&nbsp;Even if you are not a professional content writer or copywriting expert, most of today’s work runs online.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The IT industry, in particular, relies on innovative technologies.

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Visitors have become smarter — they are spoiled for choice. You have seconds to attract people to read and share your blog. The easiest way to do it is to create appealing headings.&nbsp;Catchy, attention-grabbing titles and headlines are what draws in the largest number of visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Instead of wasting your time on buffing the titles by yourself, you can enhance the heading’s copywriting value by using the <a href="https://www.aminstitute.com/process/headline.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">EMV Headline Analyzer</a>.&nbsp;EMV stands for “Emotional Marketing Value”. The EMV writing tool was created by the Advanced Marketing Institute (AMI) to analyze the emotional impact of a heading. The emotional impact contains intellectual, empathetic, and spiritual relevance analysis, all to help you create deep bonding with the potential readers. Your heading must be between 4 and 20 words to be eligible for this analysis.&nbsp;Most professional copywriters create titles with an EMV score of at least 40.00 percent, while the best ones will aim for above 60.00 or 70.00 percent EMV scores.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although primarily targeting keywords for Google Ads campaigns, the Google Ads Keyword Planner is an invaluable writing resource for anyone testing the waters with SEO, keyword research, and keyword use. Google Ads is the tool-to-go for SEO experts.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you sacrifice originality, you can not only lose valuable audience but also get penalized by Google. College papers and essay writing are subject to plagiarism detection, too. Plagiarism is among the worst copywriting sins, which, in the worst-case scenario, incurs legal fees.&nbsp;However, as much as you can try to be original, certain topics are widely explored and elaborated online. To skip Google penalizations and unintentional content-copying, always use a plagiarism checker once you finalize your draft.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Fluffy, verbose writing is compelling if you are trying to hit the creative beat. However, it can repel an audience unused to reading long, complex sentences. Moreover, it produces more work for editors.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Flesch-Kincaid Score Calculator</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Condense writing that meets the reader’s expectations is the most-sought-for copywriting skill. If you are honest as a writer, there is always space to improve in this area. Use a <a href="https://goodcalculators.com/flesch-kincaid-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Flesch-Kincaid calculator</a> to judge the readability score of your writing. The Flesch-Kincaid score measures readability according to the educational level of your reader.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Be careful with the Flesch-Kincaid score when writing for an educated, expert audience. You will have to adjust your writing to match the technical experts' level, for example, or you will end up losing them because you'll bore them to death.&nbsp;For the widest outreach, however, choose simpler words and sentences.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Gunning-Fox Index&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have time, improve readability further by adding another resource on your list of best writing tools.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Do not be afraid to simplify your sentences despite sacrificing some of your creative juices. The majority of online readers spend minutes on reading content. Pack as much useful and practical tips in fewer, shorter sentences.&nbsp;</p>

The app is available via the browser in a free version or as a paid desktop application. Apart from letting you format directly on the screen, you get immediate feedback via the app about:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Extensive use of passive voice</li><li>Phrasal complexity</li><li>Adverb density</li><li>Sentence complexity (hard or very hard readability)&nbsp;</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Too many adverbs or knotty phraseology can ruin excellent writing.

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Measuring SEO scores comes after you perform keyword research and analysis, and write, edit, and publish the content. Some errors can still slip through the cracks after all that effort. Moreover, Google makes changes to its algorithms, so you never know for sure how your website performs over time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When preparing for an IT project estimation, you need to take into consideration a lot of factors that will help you build a dedicated team for your specific project. Throughout the process of estimating your most significant IT project, you will realize that outsourcing is the best option for profitability by getting the same quality for a lower price. Moreover, <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-5-reasons-for-it-outsourcing-to-serbia-and-macedonia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="IT outsourcing (opens in a new tab)">IT outsourcing</a> is a great way to find the appropriate employees who are trustworthy and who will help you build your brand. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you are considering outsourcing an IT development team, one problem you are certainly facing at the beginning is how to prepare your idea for an exact estimation. This article will guide you through the process of preparing and conducting an IT project estimation for your business. Read carefully the step-by-step procedure below:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[5018],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IT-Project_3-1-1024x635.png" alt="List of things that must be done for IT Project estimation" data-id="5018" class="wp-image-5018"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-with-pen-writing-notes-in-notepad-2747689/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Define Your Vision</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first thing you will need to do is outline your idea.&nbsp;Illustrate your vision. What kind of problems have you recognized? What is the solution you are offering? Maybe you are rolling out a cutting-edge product. Or to put it broadly – you may have a general vision to change the world. What is your solution, and what does it do?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Whichever this is, it is essential to tell your software development company what this is and to share your way of thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Provide Accurate Brief</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your software development partners will need some basic information. It is the pitch description of your project, your needs, and your visioned path. Describe the performances of your IT Project in the most manageable formula – as well as your visioned workflow.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Explain the Specifications</strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At this point, you need to start getting technical. But remember, there is no need to go very deep into the matter. Things are getting technical here, but there is no need to get too deep into the subject. Your job is to remain on the surface. You can be concise, but leave specifics to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software development</a> team. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Set Collaboration Goals and Expectations</strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To put it simply, what do you want to accomplish and in what time? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Consider your business goals and the tangible objectives that have been bestowed. This differs from the goals concerning your cause. In this occurrence, you should also keep in mind whether your project fits your determined future concept.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These must be reasonable, in terms verified by both the developers' team and your company. The best method to do this is by setting universally-agreed metrics. Grant specifics, such as website visits, click-through rates, check out rates, bounce rates. Sometimes goals are driven by impulses, such as trends or a competitor's product. That, too, can be sufficient to help with your outline as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[5014],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IT-Project_2-1024x634.jpg" alt="Set goals when preparing an IT project estimation" data-id="5014" class="wp-image-5014"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/green-typewriter-on-brown-wooden-table-4052198/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Scope Your IT Project </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are going to contemplate and look 'deep within' for this one. That is because here is where the IT project will do some fundamental soul searching. The scale of the project, what is to be done, where will it feature, how will it feature, who will be involved – this all needs classification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here are some inquiries to kick-start the thinking process:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Is this a mobile application, or is it PC-based?&nbsp;</li><li>Is it maybe an embedded system?</li><li>What functionalities will it have? For example: (CMS, built-in search engine, navigation)</li><li>Will it need a particular infrastructure?</li><li>What about the Data Security, how rigorous will it need to be?</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Go over everything in details, leave no stone unturned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Set Time Frames </strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">You must be aware that some projects take more time than others, primarily if you want them to be done right. The deadline has a direct influence on the project's outcome, how it will be done, and the varieties of features you would like to incorporate in it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a rule of thumb, understanding that limited speed means limited quality is essential. This has more dramatic consequences when considering the budget too! But we will get to that in a second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One thing is for sure: nothing ever takes five minutes, nor does it cost five dollars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Communicate the State of the IT Project</strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As we stated earlier, depending on the design and circumstance, you may be building something from scratch. Make sure to let your new developers know the current growth of your project, as any actual information will surely be of some help. Maybe you have already created an entire, or half-finished model? In that case, let them know either way and make sure to share any essential information with them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Most significant to note is that if you have created something like this already, albeit unsuccessfully, make sure to communicate this as well. Communicating outstanding issues that have occurred in the past is essential.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Get to Know Your Dedicated Team</strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Meet the crew! And make sure everyone follows you. Precise comprehension equals progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your IT project should be built on excellent communication, succeeding expectations, and navigating among stakeholders. In projects as seasoned as those in IT development, make sure to avoid costly misunderstandings!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Have you communicated and established the parameters? Have you made sure they are understood to the finest detail by the development team?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Remember: to create - you must communicate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[5012],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IT-project_1-1024x634.jpg" alt="Getting to know the team that conducts the IT project estimation" data-id="5012" class="wp-image-5012"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-people-doing-handshakes-3183197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Estimate the Budget </strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We would not like to lie to you. The budget is a big deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Do you know how much is your organization ready to spend? Keep this in consideration of your expectations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Let us put it simply: the higher the budget, the broader the possibilities reach. Functionalities need time to be tested, whereas new features will also require development funding. Finances play a crucial role in the final quality. Bugs and glitches are best approached with room in the resources to deal with this problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Mock-ups &amp; Wireframes </strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Details are unquestionably helpful – as are the specifics. Sometimes a basic idea is a framework for perfection – make sure to bestow any introductory thoughts and plans with your development team. A reliable software house will provide professional, compact, and non-judgmental feedback to your project. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Make a Checklist</strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Think of this as a soothing reminder, preferably than a 'make it or break it' list. From our experience, it would be an astonishment if you had ready-made answers to all these points. The essential thing is to know what is to be understood and what there is to be asked. By doing so, it will assist you to recognize the competency of your next IT development team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Do you have a concept? Start with identifying a problem, solution on how to overcome that specific problem, and a concept of providing the solution.</li><li>Be precise, but not too formal.&nbsp;</li><li>Explore your idea. Ask yourself lots of questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Have confidence.&nbsp;</li><li>Set parameters. What metrics will determine your success?&nbsp;</li><li>Be realistic. Time and money are substantial circumstances with substantial consequences.&nbsp;</li><li>Details. Share as many of them as you can.&nbsp;</li><li>Accomplish. Go for it, and be confident.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As fundamental as these intents are, it is normal not to have answers to all of them. Just make sure to have them in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":25} -->
<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

Videos are everywhere we look around us. We live in an era when people prefer video content much more over the old-fashioned written content. Watching videos is far more interesting and funnier than reading long articles. People's average attention span is 8 seconds, which means that you have only 8 seconds to get the reader's attention. And this is more achievable through video content because people will more likely continue watching an interesting video rather than read an article that might seem long as an eternity. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The video editing industry is surely taking over and the processes of arrangement and manipulation of video shots are the latest trend that gets the reader's attention better than anything else. For that reason, we decided to interview our Video Editor Svetozar Petrovic, who works at our office in Belgrade, Serbia, to tell us more about his experience with video editing for our client <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Rumble (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank">Rumble</a>. Apart from being directly involved in the world of video editing, Svetozar has experience as a producer and director, too. To find out more about Svetozar's career journey and the importance of video editing, continue reading the entire interview below. </p>

<h4>1. Could you tell us how your Cosmic journey began? How would you describe the years as part of the Cosmic family?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I've been working for Cosmic since 2015. Before that, I used to work for a Serbian advertising agency. I loved that job too, but compared to Cosmic it was much more stressful. What I appreciate the most about Cosmic is that assignments are clear and reasonable, deadlines are not tight, and one's skills and creativity are respected.</p>

<h4>2. What was the biggest challenge when you started working in Cosmic Development?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development's office in Belgrade was huge back then. I was coming from a small agency with a family-like atmosphere. The biggest challenge for me when I started working for Cosmic was getting used to a large number of colleagues and to the noisy environment that comes with large collectives and open space offices. But very soon I made good friends in Cosmic and I got a smaller office where I could work from and everything became family-like again.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>3. Could you describe a situation when you encountered a technical challenge in your career? How did you overcome it?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Technical challenges happen all the time. I like to learn new things and my first impulse is to try to get to know more about the problem and solve it myself or go around it. That way you can get two things done at the same time - overcome the challenge and learn a new skill. But then again, we cannot be experts in everything, sometimes it's more efficient if you reach out and outsource an expert on the subject to help you.</p>

<h4>4. As a video editor, could you tell us whose work do you admire the most? What do you like to watch in your free time?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At the moment I work as a video editor for most of the time, but I am also interested in filmmaking and production, and people I professionally admire are mostly movie directors. I like to watch anything that's good, regardless of the genre. I guess my personal favorites would be movies that work on multiple levels, that are both entertaining and deeply meaningful at the same time. It would be hard for me to make a coherent list, but names that first come to mind are Coen brothers, Sorrentino, Ruben Ostlund...</p>

<h4>5. How do you stay updated on the latest tools and trends in the video editing industry? What video editing software have you used so far?&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">That is not too hard today when so much information is only a click away. There are many great tutorials, specialized news portals and forums out there with tons of useful new info every day. The hardest part is to keep pace with all the stuff because everything is constantly speeding up. But most importantly, you need to know how to differentiate between quality content and click baits that will waste your time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I used Final Cut Pro some time ago but I am an 'Adobe guy' and Adobe products are my tools of preference because they offer a huge amount of options and yet they are easy to understand. There are lots of 'Apple fanatics' in creative industries that would look at you with disdain if you mentioned Adobe Premiere (Adobe's primary editing software), but in my opinion, Macs are more style than substance. I am glad that Adobe Premiere has become an industry-standard now, even for high budget projects.</p>

<h4>6. Apart from being a successful Video Editor for Rumble, do you have other experience you would like to share with us?&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Fortunately enough, besides editing, with Rumble, I got a chance to do other exciting stuff such as promo videos I did from scratch - screenwriting, shooting, editing, special effects, post-production... It was a huge experience to go through all the stages of the process by myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>7. As we can witness, your passion for video editing goes far beyond editing videos. Could you tell us more about your experience as a producer and director? How did it happen? What were your responsibilities on that project?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I got a request from Rumble to make a pilot episode for a TV show that would be based on funny viral videos. I set up a team and did the production work as well as co-writing and codirecting. The whole team, from hosts and actors to tech people, was from Serbia and we did everything here from castings to postproduction. We had a crew of around 15 people, all of whom were experienced professionals. It was a very time and energy-consuming task but at the same time, it was fun and adrenaline-filled for each and every second. Definitely the best months of my career up till now.</p>

<h4>8. If you were to give a piece of advice to your less-experienced colleagues who are video editors like yourself, what would it be?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Listen to your client/director. The best editing job is the one that fits their needs as closely as possible. And while doing that, if you manage to squeeze in your artistic imprint - good for you. But that's only a bonus, not the purpose of your work.</p>

<h4>9. What do you see as your most significant professional accomplishment so far? What is your most cherished personal achievement outside of work?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">That would be the aforementioned TV show pilot and a documentary short about ex-Yugoslavian workers living in Slovenia and their rights. I hope I will soon be able to fulfill my dream and make a non-documentary short movie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Regarding personal achievements outside of work, I guess that would be some charity work I have been doing during the past few years and learning how to sail.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>10. What do you like to do for fun?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To have endless coffees and discussions with my friends, to go out clubbing, and to go sailing. I dreamed of going sailing since I was at college but it seemed impossible back then. With time, sailing became more popular and available for the general public. And around the time I got to Cosmic, I was able to take a few courses and become a skipper. So I could say that Cosmic and sailing share a special connection in my life. :)</p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question">1. <strong>Should I outsource core competencies?</strong> </strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Core competencies are the company’s capabilities that distinguish a firm from its competitors. They help define the strategic advantages of the business and build the foundation of the company’s competitiveness. Furthermore, core competencies guide the brand reputation alongside enabling business growth and developing its<strong> marketing strategy. Failing to define and nurture the business’ core competencies will lose</strong> the battle against your competition. <br/><br/><strong>Therefore, you should start outsourcing with side competencies first. After the side competencies are covered well, you can gradually continue with outsourcing core competencies.</strong></p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question">2. <strong>Do I have available in-house employees with the needed skills that can get this done?</strong> </strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Another question that you are probably asking yourself when considering outsourcing is whether you have in-house talented people who can get the tasks done. For instance, if the job assignment requires devoting a few hours to it, you can probably ask someone from inside your company to get it done. However, you cannot simply ask a coworker for a favor when it comes to more complex tasks or requirements.<br/><br/><strong>In-house skills are enough when the working task is for internal use within the company. If you need someone who is highly professional in their field of expertise and can complete complex assignments, you will have to outsource the talent you want from another company. </strong></p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question">3. <strong>Do I need to outsource now?</strong> </strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Recognizing the need for outsourcing services from another company is a crucial factor in building a successful business. When hiring in-house, you need to go through an entire recruitment process, proving to be a distraction from focusing on your core competencies. Outsourcing is a procedure that will take less time and effort than the process of hiring and training. <br/><br/><strong>So, what you need to do here is make a list of your company’s priorities at the moment and decide whether you have the time for distractions or not. If the answer is no, you are one step from turning to outsourcing. </strong></p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question">4. <strong>Will outsourcing save me money?</strong> </strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer"><strong>We will go straight forward here and answer directly: Yes, outsourcing can save you a lot of money and help you cut costs. </strong> However, the exact amount of money saved depends on how much work you need to be done and to whom you will choose to outsource. Moreover, the money-saving process may also vary based on the country where you wish to hire employees. <br/><br/>For instance, there is a vast difference between hiring someone from Northern America, Australia, or Western Europe than employing people from developing countries. To be more specific, outsourcing with IT companies with talent based in Serbia and Macedonia will help you save from 35 to 45 percent of your operating costs while boosting your productivity.<br/><br/>Asia and Latin America might be competitors when it comes to price, but there are more advantages for outsourcing from Eastern European countries. This could be a better choice because we compete with excellent work ethic, better education, great quality service, and incredible value.

<h2><strong>Basic Benefits of Outsourcing</strong> IT services</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are numerous reasons why you should begin outsourcing IT services today. Companies use outsourcing to cut costs, save on resources, operations, and increase the company revenue without hiring more employees. We have already covered the basic benefits of outsourcing in this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-outsourcing-can-benefit-your-business/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Outsourcing will not only help you save money and time, but it will also aid you with cutting down the exact amount of expenses on the needed resources.

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your website's address is the domain name, and this is what people write or type in the browser URL bar to go to and visit your website.

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Social media marketing (SMM) is the basic element for achieving success in the digital world of marketing and for attaining business growth through the usage of various platforms. Companies that want to increase their brand awareness online must begin by creating an SMM strategy, according to their industry. For that reason, we decided to interview our colleague Daniela Dukovska who has been working in Cosmic Development for more than five years. Her vast experience in the social media world took her from the role of an assistant to a team leader and she is the most suitable person to discuss which social media platform is better and why.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Throughout the past five years, Daniela and her team have been working diligently for our client <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Social-Hire (opens in a new tab)" href="https://social-hire.com/" target="_blank">Social-Hire</a> helping them achieve their social media goals and obtain positive results.

As a result of this achievement, we decided to ask Daniela how she helps with the SMM strategy and how she delegates responsibilities to her team. We were also interested in finding out which social media management tools she prefers to use and which is her favorite social media platform. To discover that and more, continue reading the entire interview below.</p>

<h4>1. You have been with Cosmic Development for over five years now. Could you tell us how your Cosmic journey started? What were the challenges you faced when you started working for Cosmic as a Social Media Assistant?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My journey as a Social Media Assistant in Cosmic Development started in April of 2015. I was one of the first employees to join the team in the newly opened office in Bitola. At that time, I was looking for a career change and I stumbled upon an opportunity from Cosmic where they needed English native speakers for one of their clients.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I had never worked as a Social Media Marketing Assistant before and at that time I was not aware of the tremendous impact it had on businesses. As this was all new for me, everything was challenging and exciting.</p>

<h4>2. Which social media channels do you recommend for businesses and why?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It really depends on the business. The best approach for most businesses is to handpick social media channels that make sense for their brand. For instance, if you are in the fashion industry, the best choice would be to use <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cosmicdevelopment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)">Instagram</a> because it is visual. If you’re in the tech industry, for example, using Twitter or LinkedIn would give the best result. Curating content and engaging with your audience is the most important when trying to grow your business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">By using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Google Analytics (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-google-analytics-academy/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, you can see which channels are bringing the most traffic to your site and concentrate more on them, rather than wasting your time on a platform where you aren’t able to get any engagement. </p>

<h4>3. Which social media management tools do you use?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Buffer, Feedly, and Hootsuite are just a few of the tools I use on a daily basis to stay on top of my social media tasks. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Buffer (opens in a new tab)" href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank">Buffer</a> is used for managing content for all social media accounts. It offers two products: one for publishing content and the other for analyzing SMM performance. I prefer the latter. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Hootsuite (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a> is a tool that is used to monitor all social media networks and I strongly recommend it for Twitter accounts. And last but not least, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Feedly (opens in a new tab)" href="https://feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a> is an app that is used to curate content.  </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being active on your social media channels shows that you are worth following.

<h4>5. What’s your favorite social media platform personally and why?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’d have to say that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="LinkedIn (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cosmic-development" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> is one of my favorite social media platforms because it is strictly for business. You don’t encounter a lot of spam as you do on the other platforms and you connect with many interesting personalities around the world. LinkedIn allows you to meet people from around the world who share similar professional interests as you. Moreover, you get to know professionals who work in your niche and share valuable experiences and insights. I like the fact that you get very positive and friendly feedback from educated people.</p>

<h4>6. Throughout the years working as a Social Media Marketing Assistant in Cosmic Development, you became also a Leader of the Social Media Marketing team. Could you tell us how you motivate your team?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I motivate my team by supporting them. When leading my team, I listen to them, value their needs, and respect them for the work they do. I do my best to provide an opportunity for each team member to learn new skills and help them grow professionally. In my opinion, communication is very important for achieving the goals we want as a team. Therefore, it is crucial to communicate on time and about every possible issue that may affect the business.  </p>

<h4>7. How do you delegate responsibilities to your team?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When managing a team, you need to divide the tasks equally so that not one person has more responsibilities than the other. Therefore, prior to delegating the responsibilities, you need to know which team member is the most appropriate person for a specific task. When I choose the right person for the job, I have a talk with them to make sure that they are comfortable with taking on the responsibilities. Afterwards, I give them instructions on who can provide the proper training and feedback. </p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>8. What is your most valuable personal achievement?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My most valuable personal achievement would have to be maintaining a happy family life while going to school to finish my degree as a lab technician in Danish. I went to school during the day and took Danish lessons in the afternoon. This particular achievement was very challenging for me because I was taking care of two small children at the time. Actually, I often wonder how I found the strength to accomplish this.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>9. What do you like to do for fun?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The current situation has disabled us to travel, which is something we used to do often. Having a close family all over the world prompts us to visit many different countries which we enjoy very much. Nowadays, I find myself doing a lot of reading, baking, and gardening during my spare time.</p>

<h5>by Hristina Efinska</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When hiring a web developer, you need to find the most suitable candidate with strong technical experience. However, it is also very important that the web developer you want to hire possesses a set of basic <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-soft-skills-for-software-developers/" target="_blank">soft skills</a>. Acquiring a web developer on your team, who has not only the technical abilities to get the work done but is an ongoing person with excellent communication skills, is the key that might bring success to your business. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">During a time when many IT companies have the "work from home" policy, abilities like clear and tactful communication with colleagues within or outside of the department who are also remote can determine whether someone fits for the job position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Below you can find several questions that you can ask your candidate when hiring a web developer at a job interview:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>1. <strong>Ask the candidates to explain to you a project they have worked on and the approach they took from start to finish</strong>.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Interview questions for a web developer's position will help you learn more about the candidates' work mindset — how they are gathering requirements, solving problems, managing user feedback, handling QA, and collaborating in a team setting. This way, you can also see whether they pay close attention to user experience. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>2. <strong>Do some roleplay. Pretend you are a tech novice and ask the candidates to explain something in plain English</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your candidate will likely work closely with other departments of your company. In other words, they will need to communicate effectively with their colleagues who are not tech-savvy, such as colleagues from marketing, sales, corporate communications, and other company areas. Ask the candidate to describe a topic all web developers should be familiar with, and look for their ability to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-improve-communication-skills-for-the-it-pro/" target="_blank">communicate</a> in non-tech terms. Some concepts to choose from are: Microservice architecture, AWS/Azure, Responsive design, MVC model, APIs, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It would be of great help if you ask them to compare web development-related terms, for instance, to make a distinction between UI and UX or between front-end and back-end, depending on the candidate experience. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>3. <strong>Ask if they have ever given a presentation</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The web developer you hire will play an important role in your company, so public speaking is a must-have skill. You will want to hire someone who feels comfortable when giving a presentation. And bonus points will definitely go to those who have spoken in front of large non-tech groups. After the presentation, ask them some follow up questions on how they gathered and organized information, and what they did to keep their audience's attention.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>4. <strong>Ask them to name a website or app that annoys them and let them describe what was wrong with it</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here is how to get an insight into your candidate's awareness of current issues in web development, as well as their problem-solving abilities. We consider the right answer to be the one where they do more than just gripe about someone else's work. They also need to offer real solutions to practical issues. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>5. <strong>Find out what they do when an application stops working</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Problem-solving is at the very core of web development, so pay attention to how candidates talk about fixing things that go awry. Do they prefer to break down the situation and analyze potential causes? Are they able to ask for help when needed, and do they know where to find answers? How do they respond if their initial idea for a solution does not work out?&nbsp; </p>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>6. <strong>Make them tell you about a time they have had to respond to negative feedback</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your candidate will have to deal with many comments from beta testers and actual users of your product. The web developer you are looking for needs to know how to take that feedback, analyze it, and turn it into an action step. Listen to them and, if needed, ask them how they would walk through the issue and arrive at a conclusion. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>7. <strong>Ask if they have ever been blamed for something that was not their fault</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is a very challenging question. However, it is a good way of catching the candidate's attitude towards teamwork. If your candidate is quick to throw a team member under the bus, that is a red alert. You need to hire a diplomatic person who does not get frustrated quickly and concentrates on working toward a solution. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>8. <strong>Find out what was the biggest challenge of working on the front end of an application</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your candidate would have worked closely with the rest of the development team. Find out if they understand how data is structured, what functions are available, how APIs are called, and how web services are configured. The chosen candidates should be capable of discussing the entire development lifecycle. They also need to show an understanding of where do they fit in. These inquiries will help you find out if you are talking to a web developer or a web designer who has a little Java knowledge. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>9. <strong>Ask them to tell you about the projects they are working on (or have worked on) in their spare time</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Technology is moving fast. Therefore, when hiring a web developer, you need to be aware that you are looking for someone who invests some of their spare time in growing their skills and staying on top of current <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/newest-web-development-trends-for-2020/" target="_blank">trends</a>. Your candidate should be able to discuss their personal projects (past or present), and if possible, show you some of their work. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[5313],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HiringWebDev2-1024x634.jpg" alt="Looking at code on laptop as part of the process of hiring a web developer" data-id="5313" class="wp-image-5313"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/gray-laptop-computer-showing-html-codes-in-shallow-focus-photography-160107/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>10. <strong>Ask what APIs have they worked with</strong>.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">All applicants should have worked with APIs, at least for well-known commercial services, like those offered by Twitter, Slack, Dropbox, and the APIs suite that Google offers. The candidate you choose to join your team should demonstrate knowledge on API functions and should know how to integrate results into their design. Bonus points would go for the candidate that has helped to develop and document their own APIs. They need to be able to talk about how they worked with the development team to create secure and useful interfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>11. <strong>Find out what do they think will be the biggest trends in future web development</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is an excellent open-ended topic you can begin when hiring a web developer. Your candidate may talk about technologies like Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages technology, Motion UI, AI-powered customer service chatbots, voice search, emerging cybersecurity threats, or advanced analytics techniques. Notice what they focus on and ask them about their genuine opinion on how this will improve, for example, user experience, what kind of challenges this technology brings, and how they would integrate the latest technology with their current work. By doing so, you can also find out whether they have the basic <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/five-personality-traits-for-novice-web-developers/" target="_blank">five personality traits</a> that every web developer must possess. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>12. <strong>Try and discover their SQL skills</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Maybe the web developer you currently need in your team does not interact directly with a database, but they must understand how data is structured. Any practical SQL experience, such as having worked as a database administrator, is highly valuable.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>13. <strong>Ask them what the most significant difference between developing for mobile and desktop is</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As you know, the most significant portion of your users browse on mobile, but the majority of the development work happens on a desktop. Your perfect candidate should know how to develop for both. They need to be able to name some crucial differences, such as screen size, touch input, limited multitasking, and variation in browser plug-ins. Candidates must know how to create a great user experience on any platform. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>14. <strong>Show them a code, and ask them to find the error in it</strong>.  </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When hiring a web developer, try not to ask your candidate to write code by hand during an interview, because it is not an ideal setting for code-writing. We suggest you show your candidate a piece of code — such as a Java class and the JavaScript that invokes it — with some strategic errors in it and ask the candidate to debug it. This is a quick way to check their technical knowledge and find out their attention to detail. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The stronger the team, the stronger the business, and it all starts with effective project management.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Programmers are notoriously difficult to seek out, screen, and onboard. They are artists; they are ambitious. Regardless of whether you have got a small team of programmers or a rapidly-expanding one, it is very likely that you will encounter situations that wreak havoc on employee happiness and morale. Many team managers within the tech industry still struggle to manage their teams of programmers. Truth be told, management does not come easily. Continue reading the article below for pointers, which will ensure that your team of programmers performs well and stays on track in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Nowadays, project management is in high demand in various industries. Why? Organizations today face fierce competition, and they have to combat global challenges. Moreover, they must answer internal/external issues without any delay. In response to those challenges, organizations need a structured approach to plan, organize, control, and manage their resources (and internal capabilities) so that they can deliver timely results.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Implement an Effective Project Management</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Project management can be better explained as "the discipline of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and shutting a team's work to realize specific goals and meet specific success criteria." Project managers need to be at a particular level of analytical and organizational skills so as to be effective in their roles. However, the project manager's job does not end with completing project scope and budget documents. At the core of their work lies their ability to understand individuals and their management skills that direct the employees toward the simplest results. For this reason, possessing an efficient array of "<a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-soft-skills-for-software-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="soft skills (opens in a new tab)">soft skills</a>" are often equally as important as possessing the hard skills that are typically related to the discipline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Project management knowledge draws on ten areas:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Communications</li><li>Costs</li><li>Human resources</li><li>Procurement</li><li>Quality of deliverables</li><li>Business requirements</li><li>Risks</li><li>Schedules</li><li>Project scope</li><li>Stakeholders</li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>The Importance of Time Management</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the extent of project management, time management is about using wisely the quantity of the time allocated to a project in order to satisfy expected deliverables and conclude all work before the project completion date. It requires project managers to ensure that their teams are organized, productive, and prompt at all times. This strategy is something that all project managers need to get comfortable with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">From a team's perspective, having a transparent understanding of the varied individuals that structure the group - and their skill sets - can go an extended way in properly and efficiently assigning tasks. During this same regard, it is essential for a project manager to review which team member is liable for which task during a project and to avoid confusion and missed deadlines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The best method for maintaining the stakeholders' timeliness is to seek out ways to keep them engaged with the project. Sending weekly or monthly emails with a summary of the tasks accomplished during that period is one such approach that makes the tasks remain at the top of the mind. When project managers are ready to communicate this example clearly and concisely to the customer, while also finding out how to adapt their approach counting on the stakeholders' previous reactions to high-stress situations, they are far more likely to realize effective results.</p>

<h2><strong>Critical Steps for Maintaining a Meeting Efficient</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another aspect of the project management strategy is to know how to keep a meeting efficient. Project managers should learn how to rely on work breakdown structures during the design phase of their projects so as to attenuate wasted time when it involves completing deliverables. Moreover, they will help team members to alleviate the strain that accompanies large-scale deliverables.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Suppose a project manager determines that an in-person meeting remains the simplest route for a particular team or group, on the opposite hand. In that case, it is important that managers follow a couple of critical steps for keeping the meetings efficient:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>1<strong><em>. Take time to determine an agenda before the meeting of precisely what must be addressed.</em></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Determining an agenda before the meeting may help in eliminating the time-wasters from the session. Usual time-wasters in a meeting are segue questions, updates that are not on topic, or one-on-one conversations between two team members that could be completed outside of the larger meeting. Moreover, having a plan for the meeting may also help get over everything that must be addressed in time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>2. <strong><em>Make sure that the rationale everyone within the meeting has been included is clear</em></strong>.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Project managers need to make meeting attendees understand that they are all included in the meeting. If that is not the case, project managers should consider removing some of the people from the list of attendees, thus saving the group, as well as the individual, from wasting their time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>3<strong><em>. Entitle someone to take notes and supply action items for the next team meeting.&nbsp;</em></strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At the end of a meeting, the attendees need to know what has been accomplished already, so having someone take notes from the meeting is very important. This may ensure that the employees are on an equivalent page about what has been accomplished already. Still, they will also know what they personally must achieve before the subsequent meeting. This action can ensure that future meetings will always be productive down the road.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-photo-3183150-1-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Project management meeting" data-id="5344" class="wp-image-5344"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/top-view-photo-of-people-near-wooden-table-3183150/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>

<h2><strong>The Benefits of Program Management in Organizations</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">So far, we have discussed the advantages at an organizational level and just a few of the ways how project management can help to enhance your entire business. But what about individual projects? What about the benefits that come from program management? What about situations when things get down sometimes, and with a simple addition of unnecessary bureaucracy in a company, employees may be left with an idea but with no room for innovation?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When organizations get to introduce project management, they can follow three important steps. They need to identify the program, develop different approaches, find the most convenient one, and finally identify an appropriate program manager.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center","fontSize":"large"} -->
<p style="text-align:center" class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Better project planning = better projects</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Benefits of Implementing Program Management</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Program management may be a crucial link between strategic services portfolios in a corporation and its component projects. By defining a program, there are significant advantages supporting an objective of subdividing component projects, then undertaking individual projects. Overall, program management strengthens the alignment towards organizational business strategy, ensures better control, and focuses on benefits realization. There are the four most important benefits of implementing program management in a company:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Provides a Comprehensive View</li><li>Works towards Organizational Benefits</li><li>Formalizes Procedures</li><li>Saves Costs</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>Is your project set for success?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The inspiration for a successful program is born long before the project even starts. Therefore, project managers must know how to predict risks, support planned governance, but most importantly, how to manage processes, controls, and suppliers. Avoiding or taking shortcuts within the crucial pre-planning and formation areas can significantly impact project success. This impact may take the shape of missed deadlines, budget overruns, reduced benefits, and burned-out teams. Therefore, managers are mandated to learn how to reduce project failure rates and how to shorten costs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>Reducing project failure rates</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Without this vital step, a project team can miss crucial details, deadlines, and eventually deliverables. The two most important things that a company must know are deciding where to spend our energy and what to deliver first. What is most vital for the customer? Which features can have an immediate impact on the company's revenues? These are only the first questions that managers need to answer in order to reduce the possibility of project failure.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Managers also have to frequently discuss with developers about what are the company's priorities. However, technical priorities are essential too: they can not always be ignored to think only about business priorities, because doing so is going to affect the business and the delivery of the software. Therefore, managers must understand that both business priorities and technical priorities must be considered when deciding on the next step they will work on.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">As we are walking in the last quarter of the notorious 2020, we can state one thing for sure: <strong>Remote work and distributed teams are here to stay</strong>. However, companies can be skeptical about moving their agile processes online when it comes to <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/work-from-home-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="working remotely (opens in a new tab)">working remotely</a>. At first glance, why wouldn't they be? Especially having in mind that Agile was initially intended for teams that are physically located together in the same workspace. Even according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">12 Principles of the Agile Manifesto</a>: "<em>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation</em>"––the first agile teams were intended to work together physically.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Some challenges arise for distributed software teams:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Synchronizing teams in different time zones</li><li>Building rapport without face-to-face contact</li><li>Collaboration between different cultures</li><li>Coordinating stand-ups and meetings considering that team members are online at the same time for a limited amount of time</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These are genuine problems, but they are far from unsolvable. With almost ten years of experience in staff augmentation and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software development services (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software development services</a>, we can share some insights and strategies to help you narrow the gap between working on-premises and remotely.</p>

<h2><strong>Structure Your Teams</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Think of your team from a software engineer's point of view: quality software architecture needs modular design, so design your software accordingly. The same goes for building teams. Every team should be able to develop a single fraction of the project, and by that, successfully reduce the dependence between your teams in different time zones or locations. You will actually make teams autonomous parts of your project or company. When a project requires team members to take part from different locations, they can focus solely on their integration points and APIs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Code reviews are considered as an important part of the development process for remote teams. Since your people are working at different times, sharing knowledge of the code between teams makes maintenance easier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Building and Maintaining Rapport</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Agile teams need to build solid rapport between team members. This brings trust, reduces misunderstanding, makes self-organization easier, and builds morale and motivation. Take time, as much as possible, to get to know everyone within your distributed teams. A personal touch is a must. Creating strong rapport will lead to smoother <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-improve-communication-skills-for-the-it-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="communication (opens in a new tab)">communication</a> between teams, which in turn leads to better workflows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After all, who said that face-to-face meetings have to be offline? Especially these days, when <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Zoom (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hangouts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Hangouts</a> have become our new-normal offices, we encourage using them in order to minimize the gap between distributed agile teams. At <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/" target="_blank">Cosmic Development</a></strong>, we are avoiding strictly scheduled Hangouts meetings for intra-team communication. Instead, we strive to create a culture of using video chats even for spontaneous informal conversations and ad-hoc meetings. Needless to say, instant-messaging tools like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Slack (opens in a new tab)" href="https://slack.com/intl/en-mk/" target="_blank">Slack</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Microsoft Teams (opens in a new tab)">Microsoft Teams</a> are very helpful in solving small issues or in simply keeping in touch. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To help address some remote communication challenges within the team, you need to stimulate team members to have one-on-one video sessions whenever possible. These should not be formal, but they still need to be focused on work and oriented around knowledge sharing in a casual way.</p>

<h2><strong>Structuring a United Development Culture</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here are the four simple rules our teams follow in order to make remote work easier:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong><a href="#Overcommunicatedecisionsandprocedures">Overcommunicate decisions and procedures</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#Minimizetheonboardingfriction">Minimize the onboarding friction</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#Clearlydefineterminology">Clearly define terminology</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#Createreportingguidelines">Create reporting guidelines&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Now, let us discuss each of them more thoroughly:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="Overcommunicatedecisionsandprocedures">1. <strong>Overcommunicate Decisions and Procedures</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When members of a distributed agile team make decisions, they need to communicate those decisions thoroughly. That sounds a bit obvious, but it is very easy to forget. Important decisions are often made in informal conversations; they are brainstormed between individuals or discussed spontaneously on calls between individuals. In contrast to this, small decisions are often dismissed as unimportant, especially if we focus on another part of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When working in a remote culture, everything, even the minute details, need to be communicated until the whole team starts moving in the same flow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is easy to lose meaning or essential information if you announce important decisions via email. Everyone in your dispersed teams needs to understand the decisions, the reasons behind each decision, and how they will be implemented. Team members that are working on outdated information can lead to major setbacks, hitting a blockade, and then re-communicating the whole process costs the team more time than accuracy sharing information in the first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="Minimizetheonboardingfriction">2. <strong>Minimize the Onboarding Friction</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can tame the "first-day-friction" by utilizing a good onboarding procedure. Remote team members should feel at home right off the bat, which helps build cohesion between team members of different cultures.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="Clearlydefineterminology">3. <strong>Clearly Define Terminology</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">While working with remote teams, clear standards around simple terminology like "<strong>complete</strong>" and "<strong>done</strong>" help manage expectations and ease communication. A clear definition of task completion eliminates ambivalence in work. For example, when sending a release that involves work from multiple teams, make sure to make it clear what <em>"complete"</em> means in this particular context: (a) the code needs to be written, (b) pull request created, (c) code needs to be reviewed and tested, (d) and finally integrated into the main codebase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="Createreportingguidelines">4. <strong>Create Guidelines for Reporting</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Distributing the development process means that not everyone is online and ready for work when problems come up. We recommend setting systems and guidelines for troubleshooting, but reports and issue tracking. You will not believe how much easier such systems and guidelines make it for anyone on the team to track down and resolve issues. Code reviews and automated tests should be part of this process as it enables the remote team to make changes and validate them so they will not have any unexpected side effects.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Maximize the Mutual Online Time</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The golden hours for remote agile teams are when most of the team members are online at the same time. This is the perfect time for stand-ups, coordination meetings, or one-on-one calls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For teams that work in different time zones, a stand-up meeting is an excellent opportunity to share their issues, obstacles, or decisions. Having the stand-ups via video calls makes it easy to coordinate and catch-up with the flow, so everyone is up and running as soon as the meeting is done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Instruct the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/project-management-as-a-crucial-aspect-of-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="project manager (opens in a new tab)">project manager</a> to closely monitor the entire team's engagement during the stand-up. If there is an undue tension, or communication is becoming unfocused and counter-productive, your team members will quickly disengage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Stand-ups do not have to be strictly daily meetings. You can have them a few times per week and use the other days for informal communication. Thus, a stand-up does not have to be just a morning routine, but you can organize it at the most convenient time for everyone that forms part of your remote agile teams.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Rumble (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank">Rumble</a> has established itself as an online resort for over 350,000 independent content creators that upload videos to their site. It allows them to exchange their video content with publishers, thus creating a specific marketplace that connects producers with distributors who publish the content on other video platforms simultaneously. Especially now, when some content creators find YouTube discriminating, the Rumble video platform has proven to be welcoming and has given the freedom to its users to feel like they can share their personal opinions with the public. And more importantly, they will not be hidden and buried in search results.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Behind every successful brand stands a great leader and a well-organized, dedicated team. Read on to discover more about what makes Rumble video a more appealing option than YouTube and how they leverage the services of <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/contact/">Cosmic Development</a> to achieve their goals.<br></p>

<h2><strong>Rumble vs. YouTube</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Ever since YouTube started hiding specific videos from their search results, people began looking for a new option that will allow them to publish their videos without being concealed from the YouTube audience. At this point emerged <a href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Rumble</a> - the best video management system - which allows everyone to create and upload video content and have it rank in search results, unlike YouTube, which buries certain videos in their search results. According to an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators" target="_blank">article</a> in the Verge: "...creators often feel abandoned and confused about why their videos are buried in search results, don't appear on the trending page, or are being quietly demonetized."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p class="has-medium-font-size">With recent events proving that YouTube is a discriminating platform towards certain people, Rumble has decided to show equal treatment to all content creators on their platform. If you take a quick look at Rumble's <a href="https://twitter.com/rumblevideo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Twitter profile</a>, you will notice many people opting for Rumble when it comes to publishing videos, thus turning their backs to YouTube. One of them is the conservative radio host Dan Bongino who has gotten an equity stake in Rumble - a platform that protects free speech.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/exclusive-fed-up-with-youtube-crushing-conservative-voices-dan-bongino-acquires-part-ownership-of-video-sharing-competitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusive interview</a> for the Washington Examiner, Bongino shared his search journey for a new video platform where his “...views won't be discriminated against." And luckily for him, he came across Rumble. Although Bongino has 600 thousand subscribers on YouTube, he says that 80 percent of The Dan Bongino Show daily episodes have been demonetized. "I'm sick of it, and I wanted to do something about it." Since September 2020, he started uploading The Dan Bongino Show - the 12th most popular podcast on Apple podcasts - to Rumble before posting it to his YouTube channel.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Entrepreneur listed Rumble as one of the Four Video Platforms Attempting to Challenge YouTube's Dominance and published an <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/340272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">article</a> stating that: "Rumble also allows creators, brands and distributors the ability to custom-brand the 4k video player, adding their own logo and styling and offering the ability to turn to choose whether or not ads will be shown on the video, or who's ads will be shown. For publishers and brands looking to adopt Rumble as their video management system or video player, one of the major advantages is their player speed; benchmarking better than all the competition, which ultimately leads to more streams and revenue for both publishers and creators."</p>

<h5>by Hristina Efinska</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Two weeks ago we decided to address an ongoing issue in the IT community. The issue is with the <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/remote-work-and-agile-teams-are-here-to-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="remote agile teams (opens in a new tab)">remote agile teams</a>. Many experts on the subject would say that the term "remote agile teams" is a bit contradictory, as the Agile Methodology was created for teams that share the same physical space. Therefore, can we make Agile work in the new normal? Yes, we can. By providing dedicated teams for our clients, commonly known as staff augmentation. We have more than ten years of experience in shaping remote agile teams. Furthermore, we asked our colleague Maja Dimitrovska, who is an important part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bookmark (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bookmark.com/" target="_blank">Bookmark</a> team, how she succeeds on a daily basis with the aforementioned issue. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>As mentioned, these are strange and challenging times to lead agile teams. Can you tell us your secret? How do you manage to keep track of everybody's tasks on Bookmark?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are often told to confront unexpected changes, that we need to be agile and resilient. This is most accurate, as we try to respond to the changes brought by the coronavirus pandemic. As our world turns upside down, most companies are reacting rather than responding. In times like these, business agility provides stability, a way to manage change and respond productively. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Agile is a framework that approves professionals and companies through developing high performing teams. In an Agile environment, changes are welcome; the client is the epicenter of the work and development is aligned with business needs. Company owners need to work on "enabling the best in their employees, rather than commanding it from them". Leaders should empower employees to be self-organized.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Remote working entails many challenges, one of which is knowing how to always be connected with other colleagues on your team, how to maintain an overall team culture, morale and motivation, how to run engaging meetings, how to track and communicate progress within the team, how to exchange ideas and share experiences (good and bad) and, last but not least, how to help the team focus on priorities. By communicating a clear vision, encouraging frequent <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-improve-communication-skills-for-the-it-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="communication (opens in a new tab)">communication</a> and providing clear boundaries, team members feel better connected and remain focused and productive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">No one said that leading remote agile teams was going to be easy, and just like many other leaders faced with the sudden change to virtual team environments, we are also reorganizing our activities and the way we work. Some of our activities during these challenging times are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Following the team's principles</li><li>Clear team delegation and prioritization of tasks</li><li>Communication, communication, communication</li><li>Daily standups with the team via collaboration tools, such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Slack (opens in a new tab)" href="https://slack.com/intl/en-mk/" target="_blank">Slack</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Zoom (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a></li><li>Random chats (one-on-one) and co-working tools (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Trello (opens in a new tab)" href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Jira (opens in a new tab)">Jira</a>)</li><li>Short-term goals</li><li>Ensuring qualitative results</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Even though the working environment has changed, the quality and quantity of our deliverables have not. Frequently sharing our achievements with the team and further improving are our regular activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">During this crisis, leaders need to learn new ways to care for their people. Connect with them to detect unforeseen issues, respect and value team skills, personal needs and differences, encourage them to do their work remotely with less supervision. This is the beginning of a new way of leading.</p>

<h3><strong>According to you, what are the benefits of using Trello for project management in an agile environment?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Task management is the core and soul of every project. First, we divide the project into smaller pieces, then decide what needs to get done and which team member to do it. Trello excels at task management and it is considered as one of the platforms that employees can learn the quickest. Tasks and projects are systematized by using a three-part hierarchy: Boards, Lists, and Cards. You can create and organize these elements in any way you want. By assigning cards to specific users, due dates and files. Trello is a fantastic Scrum and Agile solution. It’s easy to use and it works like a traditional whiteboard, in digital form. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Boards</strong>: The flexibility of Trello boards is perfectly aligned with the Scrum framework; it gives you full visibility into project stages, roles, deadlines and assignments. After you sign up on Trello, you can create multiple boards within your personal or team workspace. 

</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Lists</strong>: Boards contain lists, which are grouped tasks. You can choose to rename or reorder any of the lists to match your team's current needs for the project you are working on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Cards</strong>: The same goes for cards. You can also move the cards from one list to another with just one click. Each card may contain a description, a checklist with subtasks, additional attachments, assignees, due dates and labels. Furthermore, team members can discuss aspects of the task by commenting. Every new person added to one of the cards gets access to previous discussions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Power-ups</strong>: You can use Trello's power-ups to connect to the card applications like Slack, Github, Jira, Google Drive, and many more. There are many items on the list of power-ups, and this only guarantees that Trello is a tool that easily integrates into one's workflow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Notifications</strong>: You will never miss important developments from the tasks that you are included in; you will be updated regularly by receiving a notification. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These capabilities make Trello great in terms of flexibility and how intuitive it is to use. Trello is distinct from other tools, thanks to its simplicity. Trello project management makes a great tool, whether you need to organize a whole team's work or just your activities.</p>

<h3><strong>What other project management software do you prefer?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Project management software tools have become widely popular in recent years; there are plenty of options to choose from. Some of those tools are free to use with limited features, while others with advanced copy have more functions. Some require payment after a few days of the trial period. Choosing which tool to use can be quite challenging and also engaging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Whether you want to find a simple way to organize tasks or need a powerful, enterprise-grade system, there is a PM tool for everyone. The project management software helps project managers and teams to collaborate and meet goals on time while managing resources and costs. Functions may include task distribution, time tracking, budgeting, resource planning, team collaboration, and many more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Choosing the right approach for <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/project-management-as-a-crucial-aspect-of-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="managing a project (opens in a new tab)">managing a project</a> is crucial for successful project delivery. The way that managers manage work is defined by techniques that you use, tools that they use, and project scope activities on which they are working.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The process of leading Agile teams can be challenging at times because there are countless moving parts and evolving processes to manage. However, it is especially difficult if you do not have the right software behind you. Project managers should choose a project management tool that best suits their management style. Choosing the right tool for managing the Agile development team has not always been an easy decision. Certain factors must be evaluated as you're assessing/shopping for different tools:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Agile Framework Preferences</li><li>Collaboration Features</li><li>Team Size</li><li>Project Type</li><li>Reporting</li><li>Usability</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Some of the best agile project management tools available on the market are Trello, Jira, Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Smart sheet, etc. I have worked with different project tools during the past years and I can say that when choosing the right tool, you need to make sure that the options that the toll provides are the best fit for your team and future project plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Currently, we are using Trello, but we are open and exploring possible solutions on the market. To organize and achieve better integration, alignment with other company teams, and cover future planned project activities, we are also considering starting using Jira. Jira is a platform that allows teams to handle issues throughout the life cycle of the problem. Jira can be tailored to fit different organizational structures and is highly customizable. Jira also works great for smaller teams, as well as larger ones. The reasons why we are considering to switch to Jira are the following main features:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Transparency&nbsp;</li><li>Flexibility</li><li>User Experience</li><li>Commenting</li><li>Cost management</li><li>Categorization</li><li>Custom Workflow</li><li>Knowledge management</li><li>Integrations</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the end, no matter which project management solution you are going for, agile tools are sure to improve the way you streamline your workflow and team productivity.</p>

<h3><strong>In the end, quick question (that provokes a long answer): Kanban or Scrum? Or maybe Scrumban?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Agile is an enormous umbrella term that covers several different approaches, two of which are Scrum and Kanban. Scrum and Kanban apply agile principles in their own way to empower effective delivery cycles. Scrumban is a term for a hybrid approach making use of both Scrum and Kanban principles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Agile is all about experimentation. Scrum, Kanban or Scrumban are not competitors; they can be experiments every team should run to find their best fit. The goal of using an agile approach is to deliver more value for the business in the quickest way possible. I think it is always a good thing to experiment and implement new processes that will enhance the way the team works and how project activities are organized.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">From my experience with managing teams, I would say that Scrum is great for any team that can work on incremental delivery: a product, reporting, hardware, etc. Out of the three methodologies, Scrum is probably the hardest to adopt and the most complex and strict methodology. Scrum sprints can set clear goals and deadlines, thus giving full-control to the project manager. The Scrum framework is appropriate for experienced teams working on a product or a project which is longer than a year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Kanban gives more freedom at the start. It is the most simple and most comfortable to adopt the method. It uses a Kanban board on which it visualizes the work and the work process, ensuring that everyone in the team is on the same page. It also reveals who are the bottlenecks in the workflow without losing its flexibility in production. Kanban is a good fit for supporting and maintaining teams. I love Kanban's way of thinking to stop starting and start finishing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our team is using Scrumban. It combines the benefits of both Scrum and Kanban methodologies by using Kanban's visualization and Scrum's systematization while not introducing extra complexity. Scrumban is flexible in production and functions pretty good in large projects. It allows teams to have the agility of Scrum and the simplicity of Kanban while requiring no role updates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Scrumban is a good fit for smaller teams, startups and loyal teams bringing more efficiency and freedom, teams who manage projects and work alongside keeping the business operational. Like in the process of choosing the right tool to manage the project team activities, the same approach should be used for adopting new agile methods or implementing changes in current that are used. Research each agile method, rescan the processes and bottlenecks in the team activities and then decide what you will implement as a new process for the Team. Strategies need to be revised and will be a matter of change until the best fit for the team is defined.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Why is a case study important for your business? First of all, gaining the trust of potential clients can be a struggle. Then, before you can even expect to earn their trust and become their partner, you need to show your ability to deliver on what you promise. One of the most effective ways to do so, is by creating a case study.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this article, we would like to walk you through the creation of a successful case study for your business. A case study that positions your company as an authority on the market, explains your problem-solving mindset and provides social proof.</p>

<h2><strong>What is a case study?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">By definition, <em>a case study is an in-depth research method that consists of a detailed investigation of a specific subject of study.</em> The reason why we create case studies is to bring a complex topic closer to a broader audience. Case studies make it easier for us to connect the dots and have a better understanding of a specific subject matter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The case study has been used as a research method for a long time, especially in social sciences. It has been applied in various disciplines examining real-time life situations and providing a foundation for numerous ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><strong>Benefits of Preparing a Case Study </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. You get to tell a story of success</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When you think about it, storytelling plays a crucial part in selling your product or service. That’s why you need to present your case studies as success stories. First, you introduce your characters (the clients or customers), then you describe the problem they faced, how you helped them fight the specific conflict, and then you wrap everything up in a conclusion. Remember, you need to show everyone that your customers are the heroes here, not you. You are what helps them save the day, the wind in their back. This is what makes case studies engaging, readable and relatable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2.Your client comes first</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">

The biggest benefit of publishing case studies for your business is that they represent your customer’s and client’s voice, not your company’s. All of the content that comes from your marketing and sales teams, like webinars, blog posts, podcasts, social media posts, are often viewed as self-serving, so people tend to be slightly more skeptical of them. Contrary to that, the case studies come directly from the client, which means they act as a third-party endorsement.

<h2><strong>Key elements of an engaging business case study</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are a number of ways you can write a case study in business. While there is no straightforward answer to how to do it, here are some key elements that you need to consider:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Info about the client&nbsp;</li><li>An outline of the business case study</li><li>The proposed solution&nbsp;</li><li>The results&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":20} -->
<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Info about the client</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Introducing your client to the audience is one of the fundamental parts of a well-prepared business case study. By doing so, readers can get a grasp of the situation. They will meet the client and have a better understanding of how they are facing their problem. Here, the readers can even relate and feel as if the case study was written about them. If you achieve this, half of the work is done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>An<strong> outline of the business case study </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It’s important to have a clear outline that is easy to read and understand. You can apply various forms and techniques such as a blog post, a short video, or an infographic. It doesn’t really matter which form you choose for the case study because what makes the click is setting the right expectations for your audience. You can do this simply by listing what you will cover in what follows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>The client’s challenge</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Well, you are off to tackling the main reason why you are writing the business case study in the first place. Meaning, you need to be careful and make it easy to understand. Presenting the challenge in a simple way is maybe the most challenging part. Keep it short and to the point. The more focused you make it, the more people will read it. Always have your audience in mind and do it in an easy-to-grasp manner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>The proposed solution</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Business case studies are like stories. First, you introduce your client, then you describe the problems they had and at the end you give the solution you provided for the problem. When putting forward the ways you helped the client, do it so with the client as a key figure. Your client needs to provide inspiring stories so that your next prospect will hire you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>The results </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Solidifying a strong working relationship with your existing customers is one of the key purposes of a case study in business. If a customer is happy and supported by you, they are likely to work with you again, By making your customers look good, you will attract prospects that crave the same outcome for their business.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How to get testimonials from your clients?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">First thing's first, you need to get your clients to provide inspiring testimonials for your good service. Resist the temptation to consider just any client for a case study testimonial. Case studies for business should address the issues that potential clients might have, so be selective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Ask your most loyal clients</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The best place to start is with your company’s most loyal clients. You know, the ones that have been with you since the beginning, and you know you have brought them success. Typically, these clients have had positive experiences with your service, and as a result, are willing to share their story of success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Next up, check which of your clients have had recent wins. Speak to people who’ve done some hands-on work on the clients to identify a list of your best candidates so you can approach them first to participate in a case study.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Do your homework before you approach them</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before you reach out to your existing clients, think carefully about the timing of your request. Take time to do your research, so you understand the possible theme of the specific case study may be. For extra points, you can also research the specific person you’ll be reaching out to if you’re not already familiar with them. That’s how you’ll identify who can make an introduction, or at least help you personalize your request.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Explain why it is a win-win situation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before you reach out to your clients, make it clear what’s involved if they agree to participate. Outline the whole process ( be specific and make it understandable), how much time it will take, and how you’ll be using the case study once it's finalized. Make it clear that by participating in this, they’re assisting your company, but they have benefits as well. Being profiled in such a study can become a valuable tool for them to scale their profile and potentially position themselves as an authority in their industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At the end of the day, you work hard at what you do. But eventually, you have to show it to the world -- and, most importantly, to your potential clients. Make sure you follow the aforementioned steps that will showcase your work is effectively communicated.

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Adaptability is the capacity to react appropriately to changing circumstances. If you have adaptability skills, you can modify your attitude or adjust your behavior to different situations and different people.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h2><strong>Adaptability Skills and Adaptability as a Trait</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you include adaptability as a soft skill on our resume, you show that you can embrace innovation, quickly respond to industry trends, and handle destabilizing scenarios with confidence. Certain people have an inherent ability to be more adaptable; they were lucky to be born with this trait. Change comes naturally to them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-be-a-successful-office-manager-during-a-pandemic/" target="_blank">managing an office</a> day-to-day requires a highly flexible attitude. There is no way to handle all the curveballs an office environment throws at you successfully if you aren’t willing to shift your approach or deal with people in resourceful ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, there is no need to panic if you lack this virtue: you can train your adaptability skills. Before we dig deeper into how to become more conformable, let's find out more about the importance of adaptability skills in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Why is Adaptability an Important Skill?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Adaptability is a critical strength for business leadership. It is also crucial for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-manage-a-social-media-marketing-team/" target="_blank">managing high-performing teams</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/14-questions-you-need-to-ask-when-hiring-a-web-developer/" target="_blank">hiring new employees</a>, recruiters are interested in adaptability as a competency.&nbsp;To rank high on the adaptability competency, you need to show that you can reach your goals through various trajectories. You don't quit when facing obstacles; you innovate to circumvent them and try a new approach.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hopefully, it is more apparent now how important it is to develop your adaptability skills to thrive in the rocky world of running a digital business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Are you interested in broadening your leadership skills? <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/remote-agile-teams-management-success-story/" target="_blank">Read an inspiring story about </a>successfully managing remote agile teams.</em></p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>An Example of Adaptability Competency</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To be adaptable is desirable because it shows a richness of character and an evolving mindset. Such a mental attitude will help you:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Easily switch between tasks.</li><li>Handle multiple demands thrown at you.</li><li>Find the right people for the right job.</li><li>Work in an office, from home, or when traveling the world.</li><li>Maintain energy and pace when things get rough.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Therefore, developing adaptability starts with a mindset shift. Openness to new ideas and changing strategies are two essential elements of an adaptable character.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[5775],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-photo-2566581-1024x678.jpeg" alt="adaptability skills in a meeting at work" data-id="5775" class="wp-image-5775"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/top-view-photo-of-3-men-in-front-of-laptop-2566581/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is next to impossible to work ardently unless you gather and incorporate feedback from the environment. Handling the short feedback loops in agile methodology is a prime example of adaptability competency. In an agile team, projects will fail unless you are highly attuned to the environment and you act promptly upon every stakeholders’ feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How to Demonstrate Adaptability in the Workplace?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To show that you are open to change, you have to handle a certain level of discomfort. When things run smoothly, it is easy to be a great team player and even a better leader. But when it's not business as usual, your adaptability skills must shine.&nbsp;Having an open mindset won't be enough. You'll have to demonstrate that you possess adaptability skills through your behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[5776],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shield-2300042_960_720.jpg" alt="learning new adaptability skills" data-id="5776" class="wp-image-5776"/><figcaption><a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/shield-learn-note-sign-directory-2300042/">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Examples of behavioral indicators that show you are an adaptable employee include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Find ways to adopt changes that work rather than focusing on changes that fail.</li><li>Implement new ways of working quickly and easily.</li><li>Make suggestions about how to implement change.</li><li>Adjust strategy to changes in the situation.</li><li>Present willingness to learn new methods, techniques, and procedures.</li><li>Prioritize according to the needs of the case.</li><li>Retain a can-do attitude when facing setbacks.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you find yourself high on the scale of each of these actions, you are most likely an adaptable person. However, experience shows that you can never be too prepared - everything we do has to do with "life". Excellent adaptability in the workplace will help you set an example for your team. Furthermore, it will allow you to navigate across shifting career priorities and change is bound to happen.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How to Become Adaptable at Work</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Adaptability skills incorporate learning and taking risks. In other words, you have to be ready to frequently leave your comfort zone. Here are five ways to help you become more adaptable in life and at work:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>1. Develop in interdisciplinary areas.&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lifelong learning is nothing new. In a technologically disruptive world, there is no other way to grow in business. However, learning additional skills that go out of your usual training scope is a bonus. For example, a recruiter can get an extra perk on your resume if they can show they are highly skilled in technical recruitment and know how to assemble a software development team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another example is software specializations. With so many new software development tools on the market, becoming an expert on Shopify, for example, will help you reach out to hundreds of potential new clients who are looking for a lucrative web platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Have an exciting new idea about selling online? Let us help you create your dream team and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website-with-wordpress-and-shopify/" target="_blank">generate substantial revenue with e-commerce</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>2. Become a risk-taker.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is impossible to make any kind of progress without taking risks. Think about it: if you remain stuck in the same place, you will be comfortable. But at the same time, you won't grow. Forcing yourself to take risks is among the most desired adaptability skills you can have because risks create new opportunities. Creating new opportunities, such as identifying potential in emerging trends, is the essence of business growth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>3. Build resilience.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sometimes, new situations and new people will inevitably test you. Experimenting, learning, and taking risks may end up in rejection and failure. Therefore, one of the vital adaptability skills you can have is the capacity to quickly bounce back from adverse outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[5777],"align":"center"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/road-5567278_960_720.jpg" alt="possibilities for different adaptability skills" data-id="5777" class="wp-image-5777"/><figcaption><a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/road-away-motivation-silhouette-5567278/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Image source (opens in a new tab)">Image source</a></figcaption></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To deal with disappointment and failure, you need to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Develop your coping skills via emotional self-regulation</strong>. Simply put, welcome your emotions.</li><li><strong>Practice healthy habits to deal with stress</strong>. This means no late-night pizza and burgers!</li><li><strong>Accept responsibility for the wrong actions that led to the failure</strong>. Learn the lesson — what went wrong? How could you have overturned the outcome?</li><li><strong>Get inspired by famous failure stories</strong>. Even <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2016/01/entrepreneurs-who-failed.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Jeff Bezos and Ariana Huffington</a> had it hard at specific points in their careers.</li><li><strong>Create a plan for moving forward.</strong> Adaptability at its best showcases at the moment you choose a new path to move on from failed projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Furthermore, by making time in your daily schedules, you can strengthen adaptability through these practices to impress your clients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>4. Accept that adaptability is a team effort.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We don't live in a vacuum. Even if you work by yourself at home, you are still a part of an office. Your clients and teammates play a crucial role in how adaptable you become under trying circumstances. Clients will shift priorities. People will leave. Understand what your part is within the team and take accountability for your actions. You can't change everyone else. However, you can change yourself. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In fact, the people you surround yourself with will be the greatest challenge to your adaptability since they come from very different places. Understanding the difference between what you can (your thoughts and actions) and what you can not control (other people's thoughts and actions) is crucial to becoming a great leader and an inspiring colleague.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Are you looking to rewrite your business rulebook with new talent? We can help you <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/the-role-of-an-hr-manager-in-the-new-normal/" target="_blank">build a winning team</a> for your next project.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>5. Deliberately practice adaptability skills.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can always undertake formal adaptability training. But short courses are usually limited in their effectiveness and more appropriate for hard skills. Soft skills often require deliberate practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can tweak your adaptability with exercises, including individual and team exercises with the following activities:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Analyze and share insights about the difference in perspective and opinions about situations.</li><li>Acknowledge the possibility of other perspectives and ask questions to better understand the difference.</li><li>Think about your ingrained habits. Do you always go out to the same place? Do you use the same project management apps? Are you stuck in the same process workflow?</li><li>Question the expectations you have from people. Often, things do not turn out as expected. Distinguish between expectations and clearly defined project outcomes. Increase clarity by being bold and transparent in communication.</li><li>Write down an honest list of your own limiting beliefs and attitudes set in stone. How your fixed mindset limits your adaptability skills?</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As long as you are willing to work on these limitations, you won't lack opportunities in your career and business. By reflecting on a stale mindset, changing actions, and modifying courses, you are a visible representation of adaptability skills in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p class="has-medium-font-size">What a year, right? It’s been over ten months since the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. We lived through lockdowns; we learned how to function with social isolation; we disinfected almost anything that could be disinfected; and most important of all, we made the abrupt shift to working from home. We did all that we can to embrace the ‘new normal.’ However, leading an IT outsourcing company through one of the most challenging years in the 21 century was anything but ‘normal.’ This year brought economies worldwide to their knees. Millions of people lost their jobs. And for so many industries, the future still looks uncertain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">So, what did this mean for the successful functioning of Cosmic Development? What did we, as an IT outsourcing provider, achieve despite the new reality? What were the main things that marked 2020 for us?&nbsp; </p>

<h2><strong>Overcoming the challenges imposed by the new reality:</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Introducing work from home policy </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Since we are an IT outsourcing company with an employees-first policy and offices in three countries across four different locations, we took the prevention measures recommended by the WHO very seriously. After the first cases appeared in Canada, Serbia, and North Macedonia, we immediately shifted to working from home for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As the situation with the virus escalated and it was clear that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/remote-work-and-agile-teams-are-here-to-stay/" target="_blank">remote work was here to say</a>, we made sure all our colleagues are safe and have all the essentials to do their work at their best. And having in mind that working from home was available for us even before the pandemic, we adopted this new way of functioning with ease. You can read more about introducing remote work and the useful tools we used <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/work-from-home-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">here</a>.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, a huge role in the successful implementation of remote work as a permanent way of functioning had the HR department with representatives in each office location. </p>

<h3><strong>Keeping employees engaged during a worldwide pandemic</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As we have all witnessed, this whole crisis happened overnight, and it majorly struck our social life. Within a short time-span, the entire world adopted a “new normal” where people practiced social distancing and avoided public gatherings. The bars were shut-down, the restaurants became take-outs, schools and day-care centers were closed, and we forgot what theaters look like. And, to top it all out, there is the global <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/economic-crisis-and-recession-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">economic crisis and recession</a>.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This harsh reality affected us all. Employers had little time to adapt and provide all the required conditions for successful operation. Whereas employees had to make sure they stay proficient and effective in a whole new scenario. And with the kids staying at home, caring for family members, and psychological pressure from the lockdowns, it became very stressful.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being the link between employers and employees, HR teams worldwide had to rethink their role as they had to adjust whole companies to social distancing practices and a new work environment. More than ever, they played a crucial role in keeping their teams productive, motivated, engaged, and connected. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development’s HR manager spoke thoroughly about <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/the-role-of-an-hr-manager-in-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">measures that need to be taken</a> in order to ensure employees’ wellbeing during these, well, let’s say, unprecedented times. She pointed out holistic and agile people management as best practices because every individual is different and unique in their own way. “To do so, our department has been in touch with all employees on a regular basis. Personal coaching in the form of one-on-one sessions were introduced for the most affected employees. While for the outgoing, we organized online contests and events where people could spend time with each other.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> The name we gave to these activities was “<a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/cosmic-beats-isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Cosmic Beats Isolation</a>”, and we gotta say, it was fun being part of them. </p>

<h3>2. <strong>Events worth mentioning </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In early March, two Rumblers, Marija and Natasha, attended the Digiday Publishing Summit for a good reason. As Business Development representatives and one of the first people to join the Rumble team at Cosmic, they had an excellent opportunity to mingle with the most prominent names in the publishing industry. An event where media leaders talked about the latest trends and useful tools. There were interactive workshops, speed networking sessions, and cocktail hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another event of no less importance was the Virtual HR Transformation Summit. Cosmic Development’s HR Manager Biljana took the stage and shared her valuable insights on contemporary HR practices and retention strategies. She joined a distinguished list of HR professionals to discuss Human Resources management’s most critical aspects of the new reality. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Having a website and a strong online presence is the backbone of every business. It has become crucial in ensuring any business’s survival and especially important for small and medium companies and startups. Simply put, an effective website will take your business to another level and put you a step ahead of your competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, creating a website can be a time-consuming and exhausting process that requires skill, knowledge, and practice. Fortunately, we live in a time when it has never been easier to create a website, even with zero technical knowledge. With the help of easy-to-use services known as website builders, you can build a high-quality website from scratch. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>So, what exactly are web builders and how do they work?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>In simple words, website builders are tools that help you quickly and easily create a website with no coding or design skills and without web developers' help.<br></strong></em></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the plus side, many of them provide hosting and domains. These tools allow both beginners and tech-savvy users to create a fully optimized website within minutes. They are easy to use, have pre-coded templates, analytical tools, SEO tools, and much more. The steps are simple. All you have to do is choose a template from the many available in the website builder's library. Then customize the template design using the drag-and-drop function that allows you to move and add elements like images, video, text, titles, and buttons wherever you want on your page. Upload your content, preview, and publish. That's how easy it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Choosing the right online web builder can be overwhelming. It would be best if you made a choice based on your unique needs. However, any good website builder should have the following features:</p>

<h3>What to do in case you need a more powerful website?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Website builders, like the ones reviewed in this article, are great&nbsp;for small businesses and individuals.&nbsp;Still, if you are looking for a powerful hosting solution for a huge site, they may not be best for you. Building a successful website requires industry knowledge and experienced web developers. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">A dedicated development team</a> should definitely manage complicated projects that require design and code.&nbsp;Although this option is more expensive, it is worth the investment. These professionals will offer you excellent design solutions, expert guidance, and a high-quality website that generates traffic and income.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>No matter which website builder you will choose, remember, the price you’ll pay for a website is much lower than the price of not having one and getting left behind.</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Starting and growing your own business, especially if you are just getting into the game, has many challenges. Indeed, it is a gratifying endeavor that allows you independence and flexibility. But it is also a risky and daring journey. You need to have a clear vision and be passionate about your idea. You need to surround yourself with like-minded people and keep yourself motivated to push through the hard times. Fortunately, entrepreneurship is a well-trodden path. One of the best ways to keep yourself on track is to hear inspiring stories of successful entrepreneurs who have already been there. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We recently had the pleasure to interview David Kosmayer, a highly successful and motivated entrepreneur who shared his story to inspire other entrepreneurs worldwide. And his whole business idea is centered around helping other entrepreneurs succeed and grow their businesses.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is David Kosmayer?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">David Kosmayer is the CEO and Founder of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bookmark.com/ai-website-builder">Bookmark.com</a>, an AI-powered website builder based in Toronto, Ontario. Having a strong sense of entrepreneurship and initiative, David was just 22 years old when he created his first company, Marketing Extensions Inc. Under his leadership, the online affiliate and marketing agency grew to $60M in revenue with a 55-person team in less than a decade. While working at the agency, David realized that making a successful website and building an online presence is a complex, expensive, and time-consuming process. So when he decided to move on from his first company, he had a burning desire to simplify web creation and reform the future of web design.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">David’s idea was that anyone should be able to build a website quickly and establish a strong online presence without much effort.&nbsp; That is how Bookmark.com was born, the world’s first and fastest AI-powered website builder.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Bookmark?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>Bookmark is not just a website builder; it is an innovative platform that will bring your entrepreneurial dreams to life.</em></strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> David established Bookmark back in 2014. He created a cloud-based&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-6-website-builders-and-their-benefits/">website builder</a>&nbsp;designed to empower small businesses, startups, and solopreneurs who want to grow their online presence. Bookmark's secret weapon is AIDA, its Artificial Intelligent Design Assistant, that will help you create a personalized and unique website within just a couple of minutes. It is straightforward to use, and you don't need any technical knowledge or coding skills. It will save you time and money and help you focus on developing your business instead of worrying about the technical aspects of website creation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>If you are ready to take your small business online, you can create a <a href="https://www.bookmark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">free website</a> with Bookmark today!</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Seven years later and Bookmark is growing fast. Its users are business owners and entrepreneurs who want to create high-quality websites and quickly establish a strong online presence. The potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in web design is enormous. The AI-powered website will continue to evolve on its own as the learning algorithms analyze data and suggest optimal changes for your business.  </p>

<h3><strong>What makes Bookmark one of a kind?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bookmark is one of a kind because we are an AI-powered website builder. To dive deeper into who we are, you need to understand that we have been building our AI infrastructure from day one. We don’t use templates. Instead, we work with each individual section, and depending and who you are and what your brand is, your site will come together like a personalized puzzle. On top of that, our AI is optimized to actually bring customers towards your business, growing your online presence each step of the way. </p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>What was your biggest doubt when starting your business?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The biggest doubt I’ve had when starting my business was instilled into me by all of the naysayers around me. They constantly told me the message of “the website builder market is too saturated, you won’t be able to compete with their billion-dollar players.” At first, I didn’t care, but then it did start to get to me a little bit. However, I stayed determined, and here we are today. </p>

<h3><strong>What was crucial for Bookmark’s success?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something that was very crucial to the success of Bookmark was being able to incorporate machine learning into the architecture of Bookmarkfrom the very beginning. And I couldn’t have done this without the amazing tech team that was behind our vision. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Please tell us more about your collaboration with Cosmic Development?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I started with Cosmic Development in 2015 with a team of only 4 talented individuals. We built the foundation of Bookmark together, and they were along for the ride for a long time, with two of them still on the team today, 6 years later. Now that we’ve grown and have investors and partnerships, we are able to continue to add engineers with Cosmic, and that takes a huge and important piece. Of the company off my hands, allowing me to focus my efforts on other facets of the brand. </p>

<h3><strong>What’s the biggest benefit of having a remote dedicated team?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Having an IT company that is dedicated to hiring the best professionals is amazing to have as a turn-key service. Whatever I need, the team at Cosmic works hard to help me to achieve. Also, as they are based in Macedonia, I have absolutely fallen in love with the country, and I have visited 11 times in the past 6 years, so that’s is a huge plus too. </p>

<h3><strong>What are the future plans for Bookmark and who can join your team?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We just completed another investment round from our great partners at Moneris, and we are now on a major hiring spree! We want to hire Front-end and Back-end Developers, Machine Learning Engineers, Scrum Masters, Product Managers, PHP &amp; Laravel Developers, and many more. Having that said, we are really excited to grow our company, we plan on adding at least 20-30 team members within the next few years, and that’s not even counting our growing team in Toronto! If you are interested in a career in any of the titles listed above, contact Cosmic, because Bookmark is hiring. </p>

<h3><strong>What’s your advice to small business owners?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My advice to small business owners is to find an unsolved problem and try to come up with a solution for it. There are constantly new ideas popping up everywhere, in every industry. If you can solve some sort of relevant problem that currently doesn’t have a fix, then that is a business idea that is waiting to be discovered. Also, stay focused, motivated, and dedicated. Keep your eyes on the prize and remember what your final goal is! </p>

<h3>Here is what our people have to say about their Cosmic experience:<br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Vladimir Novacki</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Vladimir is our Chief Technology Officer, and his carer path in Cosmic Development is more than inspiring. He has over twelve years of background in the industry and he is directly involved in the implementation of solutions for huge companies, ranked in the top 5 in their field, such as Rumble and&nbsp;AFV, among others.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Vladimir, could you please tell us how it all started? </strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>Like many great things in life, this one started by chance. One of Cosmic Development's founders gave a speech at the university, and I remember being so inspired by what he had to say about the IT industry. I instantly recognized Cosmic as the right place for me and decided to apply for their very first internship program. It turned out there were more than 50 undergraduates who applied for that program as well, but I was fortunate enough to be one of the four chosen interns. We were given the opportunity to work on real applications used by lots of people. The whole experience was truly priceless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After finishing the internship program, there was mutual interest between the company and myself to continue working there as a full-time employee and to keep working on those projects. Over the years of continuous learning and improvement of my skill set, I was empowered to nurture and grow my career in the company and consequently became the CTO. I guess I was lucky enough to find the perfect fit company right from the start.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Emilija Nikoloska </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emilija is a Senior Business Consultant with ten years of experience. She is with the company from the very beginning and has a lot to say when it comes to growing within Cosmic Development.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Emilija, can you tell us how and when did your journey with Cosmic Development start?</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>My Cosmic journey started back in 2011. I was one of the first six people that Cosmic hired at the time. I still remember my first day at the office, like it was yesterday. We were all new employees, and it felt pretty much like the first day at school, but this time for grown-ups 🙂 . We were all very excited about the new job positions and the new office environment at the beginning. Yet, we felt nervous and uneasy as we all took part in a new venture that was still to be proven. From this point of view, I can only say that all of those "worries" were unnecessary as everything turned out just fine. Looking back, I can say I joined Cosmic when it was still a concept, an idea, and now I'm glad that I've been doing my part to make that idea a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<h4>Zharko Mirchevski </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Zarko has been one of Cosmic Developments MVPs for almost eight years. He has a lot of experience as a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/" target="_blank">software engineer</a>&nbsp;and senior PHP developer, and his contribution to projects like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.md.com/" target="_blank">MD.com</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bookmark.com/" target="_blank">Bookmark.com</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rumble.com/" target="_blank">Rumble.com,</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://somespider.com/" target="_blank">SomeSpider.com</a>&nbsp;is highly appreciated.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Zarko, what was the biggest challenge when you started working in Cosmic Development?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>Remembering the names of all new colleagues, but I guess that's probably the initial challenge everyone gets faced with when starting a new position in an unfamiliar working environment. On a more serious note, I'd say that the biggest challenge was adopting the company culture and procedures. The social aspect is as important as the technical part of a new job.</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>What Do Our Clients Say About Us?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our client-centric approach gave us a competitive advantage and has been a catalyst for our growth. Cosmic Development has established itself as a reliable and trusted business process transformation partner throughout the years. We've built a solid and professional relationship with our clients and respond effectively to their specific needs. They've been critical to Cosmic's growth and success, and we look forward to working with them in the coming years.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>It's tough to outline the "benefits" of working with Cosmic Development because they are integral to our operation. In a certain sense, the benefit is that they allow our business to operate. To get into specifics, one of the major benefits is cost savings. Having our entire content team based in Canada would have been prohibitively expensive. Another significant benefit is that they make our content better. The Cosmic employees working on Factinate are fantastic, highly educated people who are very dedicated to the work they do, and this shows in the results.</p><p>I would undoubtedly recommend Cosmic Development (and we have too many now-clients of Cosmic)! To folks in our industry (online publishing) or looking to get into the industry, Cosmic has unique expertise: they can build and manage the website you need. Additionally, Cosmic's business process employees and content creators could help so many businesses in various industries. The economics just make sense, and the people are top-notch.<br></p></blockquote>

<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>I started with Cosmic Development in 2015 with a team of only four talented individuals. We built the foundation of Bookmark together, and they were along for the ride for a long time, with two of them still on the team today, six years later. Now that we've grown and have investors and partnerships, we can continue to add engineers with Cosmic, and that takes a huge and meaningful piece. Of the company off my hands, allowing me to focus my efforts on other brand facets.<br></p></blockquote>

<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>All-in-all, Cosmic Development is a competitive advantage for us.&nbsp;</p><p>With the recent market turmoil caused by the Coronavirus, working with Cosmic amplifies the necessity and importance of our partnership. As a proactive company, we decided to avoid having to raise capital to fund daily operations years ago. Instead, choosing to work with Cosmic helped design our cost structure differently from competing companies, making it easier to weather storms like the one we are facing this year.</p><p>With their competitive pricing, quality of the teams, level of service, and recruitment process, this was a no-brainer. In addition, all their staff is dedicated and exclusive to a single client at a time. This is unique because they really bring the Rumble brand loyalty inside their Cosmic offices. If you wonder what I mean by this, just look at the team's picture below.<br></p></blockquote>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">These are the crucial questions you will undoubtedly face at the start of every software development journey.

<h2> In-House Software Development&nbsp;</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br> First, let's clear things out. <em>What is in-house software development?</em><br>In simple words, it is when <strong>the team of developers works in your company's offices and builds the software to support the business operations and the specific needs of the company</strong>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">That means you are responsible for recruiting and hiring full-time developers and provide them with a regular salary and other employment benefits. Furthermore, you are also responsible for providing the resources and infrastructure to support the software development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3> &nbsp;Pros of In-House Development</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Control</strong>. With an in-house team, you can have complete control of the development process from beginning to end. Additionally, you can manage teamwork and quickly resolve any issues that may come up.&nbsp;That means you have the opportunity to know the abilities of every team member and can assign them tasks accordingly.<br></li><li> <strong>Cultural Fit. </strong>Since you control the recruiting process, you will certainly choose people that share your values and organizational culture. That helps employees to integrate with the company efficiently and eases communication.<br></li><li> <strong>On-Site Availability.</strong> Being in the same office and within the same time zone makes the process faster and more effective. If you have a question, you can always ask your colleague and get an immediate answer. Although this point is slowly losing value as more and more people work from home.<br></li><li> <strong>Response Time.</strong> Having an in-house team increases the speed of implementing unexpected changes.&nbsp;If there is an urgent need to change a project's features and make certain modifications, a team under your control can make the changes faster.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Cons of In-House Development</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>High Cost.</strong> In-house software development is time-consuming and way more expensive than outsourcing. Maintaining a team takes time and money. It is costly because it includes recruitment and onboarding and training costs, salaries, and other employee benefits. Plus, infrastructure, taxes, rent, and much more.<br></li><li><strong> Narrow Talent Pool. </strong>Lack of talent is a serious problem for in-house business models. And with the fast development of the IT industry, the competition to hire the best developers is higher. The local talent pool available might not be adequate for your business plans and technical needs or fit into the planned budget. When there is a talent shortage with a specific skill set, your only option is to pay a significantly higher amount to bring in the required talent or consider the global outsourcing market.<br></li><li><strong> Staff Turnover.</strong> The technology industry has the highest turnover rate for any industry. One of the most significant in-house software development risks is poor employee retention. Developers are in high demand and frequently switch jobs in search of better opportunities. There is always a risk that a lead developer will leave during crucial stages of the project, which in turn harms software development productivity and product quality and can even bring a project to a standstill.</li></ul>

<h2>Outsourced Software Development</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6250} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/office-1081807_1920-1024x684.jpg" alt="Outsourced software developer working from home" class="wp-image-6250"/><figcaption>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1081807">Free-Photos</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1081807">Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Outsourcing software development is a business strategy of hiring an external company to fulfill your software requirements.</strong> In this case, your software development team will work remotely, usually from another country. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These teams have experience and skills gained while working on development projects for clients across various industries. Businesses from startups to enterprises turn to outsourcing specific business functions such as IT, marketing, or human resources. This helps them grow and get quality services at lower rates. Outsourcing has become an essential part of business management worldwide. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Recently, Opinium and LiveArea provided <a href="https://www.liveareacx.com/blog/livearea-covid-business-research/">research</a> that explores the impact the pandemic has on businesses and operations. According to it, 10% of companies already outsource their marketing department, and 32% consider outsourcing. To develop greater business agility and resilience, companies are looking to reduce risk through outsourcing, and it is expected that the outsourcing market will grow significantly in the coming years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><br> Pros of Outsourcing Software Development</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Significant Cost Reduction.</strong> Software outsourcing allows companies to hire top-notch talent at a reasonable price. You'll be paying local market rates for skilled labor. Since you are paying for the service, not for the work, you will reduce the cost of hiring, training, and housing staff. Plus, you'll save much money on administrative expenses like equipment, rent, and software licenses. This allows a company to develop its product at a lower price.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li> <strong>Access to Top Talent. </strong>Software development outsourcing solves the problem of a lack of local tech talent. Outsourcing gives you immediate access to highly skilled experts from all over the world without any difficulties or increased costs.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong> Increased Efficiency. </strong>Delegating the recruitment and training process to an outsourcing partner will allow you to allocate your time and energy to focus on core business activities and future strategies. Having access to quality tech talent means that you can begin building your software almost immediately and launch your product faster, thus gaining a substantial competitive advantage.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Shared Risk.</strong> A quality outsourced IT service provider will take the time to study your project specifications and identify any potential issues. That will help mitigate any risks associated with your project.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Cons of Outsourcing Software Development</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Less control.</strong> Although you will be working closely with the IT company, you won't be able to control your IT functions as well as you could with an in-house team. You can't monitor the development team and see how tasks are performed. However, this should not be an issue if you find a trusting outsourcing partner. Plus, you can always track your team's progress using modern software and management approaches that will help keep them accountable and help you maintain visibility.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Communication Issues. </strong>Language barriers, cultural differences, and contrasts in time zones can significantly impact the whole project. Software Development is an industry that requires intensive communication, especially during the requirements phase. If your outsourced team doesn't have a good grasp of English, that can be a valid concern. Moreover, if you partner with an offshore company located in an entirely different time zone, that will require an additional level of planning and management. When you don't have face-to-face communication with your development team very often, you may not receive responses as quickly as you'd like, and it may slow down the project. However, experienced providers know how to deliver optimal services regardless of their location and offer you software developers who speak excellent English.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li> <strong>Risk of Exposing Confidential Data. </strong>When you outsource important IT functions, the outsourcing agency gains access to all of the information that passes through the organization's computer system and there is a risk that confidentiality and security may be compromised. You can mitigate these drawbacks by teaming up with an experienced, reliable, and trustworthy outsourcing company.</li></ul>

<h2>Our Hybrid Approach&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you still can't decide which approach is better, you may consider a third option, a hybrid approach, or as we call it, staff augmentation. In some cases, the combination of in-house and offshore software development will deliver the most benefits. The blended workforce model will let you develop an agile, cost-efficient workforce that will match your business needs long term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cover-rumble-1024x549.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5796"/><figcaption>Providing a hybrid dedicated team for one of our clients
</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, your in-house employees can be a better choice at the start of the project, but as you progress to the next stages, it is best to hire a remote, dedicated development team. Using the hybrid model, you will get better quality, more timely production, and the ability to scale operations at a lower cost. Plus, if you are concerned about security risks, the hybrid approach is probably the most fitting for your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How do we do that?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">By providing dedicated talent solutions for our clients, also known as <strong>staff augmentation.</strong> When you partner with us, you will usually get more than team augmentation. We can also cover various software-related services, such as analysis and design, quality assurance, project management, or support and maintenance. Our top-tier developers will become a part of your in-house team and will work closely with them for as long as you need them. The exchange of knowledge and ideas between in-house and outsourced developers can be highly beneficial and will help you overcome the challenges that come in the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We have more than ten years of experience in shaping remote agile teams, and we have learned how to tackle the disadvantages of the above-mentioned models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Pros of Our Hybrid Model</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Control.</strong> Our clients have more control over every step of project development and implementation. We have client managers assigned to every team, and every office has its HR Manager.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Cultural Fit.</strong> With close communication with our clients, we make sure every candidate we hire fits their company culture and unique requirements.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Response Time</strong>. Our dedicated client managers are there to help you if there's any delay or issue. We will handle your needs in a personalized way, and the team will dig deep into your business and get to know your actual needs.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Communication Issues.</strong> We have team managers who are responsible for the availability and performance of their team members daily. Each member of the team is composed of highly experienced software engineers with the required talent and expertise.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>No</strong> <strong>Risk of Exposing Confidential Information.</strong> We sign NDA's and follow procedures that protect every client's data.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Cons of Our Hybrid Model</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Recruitment may take longer than anticipated.</strong> In exceptional cases, when the set of skills is not standard, the recruitment process can take longer than usual. Thus, we keep the client updated on the process at all points, and we are fully transparent.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">All this and a combination of typical outsourcing benefits make Cosmic Development a close and trusted partner, not just a temporary service provider. Reaching a maximum level of productivity with our staff augmentation hybrid model is a very realistic goal. You can immediately benefit from reduced talent costs and increased development capacity to achieve your goals.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Websites play a big part in your business's success, but having a website alone is not enough. If you want your website visitors to engage, you need to keep the website up-to-date, bug-free and secure. Only a healthy and well-performing website can bring traffic and potential customers to your site.<br><br>Website maintenance is a main priority for businesses today, and in this article, we will discuss how to maintain a high-volume website in the long run and why it is so important.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is Website Traffic, and How is it Measured?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The number of visitors that come to a particular website is called website traffic. It is measured in visits or sessions recorded on the site's server that communicate with the user's device. Website traffic depends on the website's purpose, the visitors' goals, and how they discovered the site. There are many ways to measure traffic. By using web analytics tools like Yandex Metrica, Google Analytics, and Alexa Rank, you can measure several different aspects of your website traffic like visits, sessions, page views, unique visitors, etc.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Website traffic is an essential metric for online business effectiveness because it gives businesses valuable insights into the interests of their visitors or potential customers. Regular website traffic analysis will help you make better future marketing decisions and grow your business by giving your customers what they want. For a high-performing website, both quantity and quality are essential. However, high-quality traffic is what will get you customers and increase conversion and sales. Quality traffic is targeted traffic. That means that targeted visitors that come to your site have a particular objective and have already shown interested in your products and services, thus more likely to convert and make a purchase. Plus, those visitors are more likely to stay with your business and refer your website to others.</p>

<h4><strong><em>By getting more website traffic, you get more opportunities to convert users and sell your product or service.</em></strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Finally, high traffic will get you a higher page rank, higher domain authority, and better search rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to ranking, the most crucial aspect of website traffic is organic traffic.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://videos.brightedge.com/research-report/BrightEdge_ChannelReport2019_FINAL.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">53.3% of all website traffic</a>&nbsp;comes from organic search. That is because Google and other search engines rank websites based on the keywords and SEO tactics that are used. The better the description and use of keywords, the more organic traffic a website gets. SEO or search engine optimization is the process of optimizing a website to rank as high as possible in organic search engine results. And you know the rule, the higher you appear in the search results, the more relevant and authoritative your site is.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">An effective SEO strategy should create compelling on-page content, gain backlinks and improve the site's architecture. Websites that are well-optimized get more traffic and generate more leads and sales.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>2. Use Paid Advertising</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Paid (or PPC) advertising is an excellent way to increase traffic and jump to the top of search results. Paid advertising means buying traffic with online ads, or putting it in other words; you pay each time someone engages with your content.  <br> The key to any successful advertising campaign is getting high-targeted keywords. Choosing the right keywords to bid on you is targeting the right people, which is most likely to result in clicks, conversions, and consistent traffic to your page. It is an excellent solution if you're looking to increase website traffic fast, but it can also be expensive, especially for small businesses.</p>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>3. Use Video Marketing&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-video-content-brought-success-to-rumble/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Video content</a>&nbsp;and organic rankings go together. Search engines are looking for highly engaging content, and Google's algorithms are increasingly prioritizing websites with video content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The audience is engaging with video content more than ever before. According to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most recent marketing statistics</a>, 86% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, up from 63% over the last year. 93% of marketers say that it's an integral part of their marketing strategy. Also, we need to mention that by 2022, online videos will make up&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 82% of all consumer internet traffic.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a part of a comprehensive content strategy, video marketing is an excellent tool for increasing website traffic. Video content is entertaining, engaging, and easy to consume. Additionally, it will increase CTR, lower bounce rates, and increase dwell time. Having that in mind, don't hesitate to invest in high-quality video content and get more traffic.</p>

<h2>Why is Website Maintenance Important?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We explained above that getting on the front page of Google top results is not an easy task, and it requires hard work, dedication, and knowledge. But getting to the top is only half the battle. Staying on top and maintaining high traffic is equally as hard and brings additional challenges.<br><br> To maintain your top position and high volume traffic, you need to invest in good website maintenance services. Website maintenance is the process of regularly analyzing your website for problems and making sure that it remains updated, safe, and secure. High traffic indicates a well-performing website, but it needs careful management to provide the proper visitor engagement and positive user experience. If your website is not adequately maintained, too many requests can crash it and slow down your page load time. That will affect your marketing data and search engine results page ranking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br>  A well-maintained website has many benefits – it will encourage traffic growth and boost your SEO and search engine rankings. A seamless user experience will motivate your customers to buy and promote your products and services. And it will save you money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>In the long run, website maintenance is always less expensive than website repair. The cost of customer acquisition is significantly higher than the cost of customer retention.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And remember, it doesn't matter if you decide to create a website with the help of a website developer or a professional web builder. Website optimization and maintenance is still one of the most important things you can do for your business. However, if you are a small business with a limited budget, you may consider a website builder for developing a website.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-6-website-builders-and-their-benefits/">Here</a>&nbsp;you can read more about their benefits.</p>

<h2>The Difference between Scalability and Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Performance and scalability are essential aspects of software design. They are often confused, and although they are interrelated and affect each other, they are different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Scalability is a system's ability to expand by adding extra hardware or upgrading the existing hardware without major application modifications. A scalable system should handle large amounts of users, data,<br> or traffic without disrupting the services to the end-users. Scalability increases overall performance, prevents system downtime, and ensures a seamless user experience. That results in increased customer engagement boost, increased customer retention rate, and increased revenue and cost reduction for your organization. Building a flexible infrastructure that can easily manage the load should be a vital network design goal.<br></p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Performance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Website performance or website speed is a software quality metric that indicates how quickly a browser can load fully functional webpages from a given site after a user clicks a link or makes a request. The page load time is the critical metric to measure and improve website efficiency and is essential for long-term success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Good website performance means a swift and seamless user experience, driving more traffic, and having better conversion rates. On the other hand, websites that take a long time to load will have adverse effects on the user experience, site traffic, and SEO and drive users away. A fast website is a competitive advantage. Every website owner must understand that every second count and focuses on improving page load time and performance.</p>

<h2>What do Visitors Expect from Your Website?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If your goal is to attract your customers' attention and gain new ones, you have to make sure you offer them want they want and even provide things they didn't realize they wanted. When designing and updating your web presence, you should consider some essential factors in creating the best possible user experience. Regardless of your industry or business, here are six must-have elements for every website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>1. Fast Loading Speed&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Website loading speed is now more critical than ever. As technology advances, modern internet users are becoming increasingly impatient. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks.pdf">Google</a>, almost 53% of mobile site visitors will leave if a web page took longer than 3 seconds to load. Additionally, page loading time has become an essential factor to search engine rankings, thus directly influencing your customer's ability to find your site.<br><br>The correlation between loading speed and positive user experience can also be shown with the following&nbsp;<a href="https://cxl.com/blog/11-low-hanging-fruits-for-increasing-website-speed-and-conversions/">statistics</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6384} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1823558720-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6384"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>47% of users want pages to load in two seconds or less.</li><li>A one-second delay can result in a 7 percent loss in conversions and a 16 percent decrease in customer satisfaction.</li><li>Pages that load&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/page-load-time-really-affect-bounce-rate/">within two seconds</a>&nbsp;have an average bounce rate of 9%, while pages that take five seconds to load have a bounce rate of 38%.</li><li>Slow loading during high traffic times can lose up to three-quarters of visitors.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Having all this in mind, it is crystal clear that optimizing the loading speed of your page should be at the top of a to-do list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>2. Clear Navigation Structure</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">How you structure your website navigation is very important to the performance of your site. If your website visitors can't find what they are looking for and finds your content confusing, they will move on to your competitors. Poor navigation is terrible not only for visitor experience but also for SEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[6386]} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1828191023-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="6386" data-link="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/?attachment_id=6386" class="wp-image-6386"/></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">An organized and transparent navigation system is intuitive and easy to use. It has a clear menu structure and the ability to navigate between pages quickly and efficiently. A site that is easy to get around allows visitors to quickly find the information they are looking for and encourages them to stay longer. It also helps search engines index important information efficiently and effectively. All that subsequently<br> leads to more conversions and sales for your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>3. Fresh and Engaging Web Content&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Web content refers to the text, images, audio, and video published on a website. Providing accurate content tailored to a specific audience clearly and efficiently will keep users on your site, drive conversions and establish brand authority for your businesses. Also, it is crucial to optimize the web content for search engines to respond to the keywords used for searching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Examples of great content include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6387} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1763366099-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6387"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Clear descriptions of your services</li><li>Contact information</li><li> Educational blog posts</li><li> Product images and helpful descriptions.</li><li> Testimonials from past customers</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Content is one of the essentials of any website. If you want to have a quality site, you must provide visitors with fresh and relevant content displayed neatly and simply.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>4. Safety</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Regardless of the size of the website you are running, users expect a safe online experience. Also, Google gives preference to secure pages. So, suppose you want to optimize search engine performance, establish credibility with visitors, and maintain a professional web presence. You should take a proactive approach and protect your company and your customers' data in that case. Here are some basic steps that can be applied:</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li> Back up your data regularly</li><li> Use SSL encryption</li><li> Keep your software up-to-date</li><li> Use CAPTCHA and spam filter plugins</li><li> Use strong user names and passwords</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>5. Clean Design</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Website design plays an essential role in how your audience reacts and interacts with your brand. Simple and clean design, white space, nonintrusive page layouts, stylistic fonts, and colors promote on-site engagement and improve user experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>6. Mobile Optimization</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Mobile optimization is the act of making your website compatible with mobile phones to provide an optimal user experience. If a website is not optimized for popular smartphones and their sizes, users may leave your website. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/297137/mobile-share-of-us-organic-search-engine-visits/">Statista</a>, around 60 percent of organic search engine visits occur on mobile devices in the U.S. Having that in mind, it is clear that mobile optimization is vital for your business's success as it increases both conversions and encourages users to return.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today's internet users have very high expectations of the websites they visit. If a website doesn't provide value to the end-users, they won't visit your website, and they won't do business with you. So make sure your website is fast, easy to use, and safe.</p>

<h2> Traffic Growth and Traffic Levels</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Business websites usually start with minimum visitors, but as they grow and traffic increases, they will have to overcome many challenges to support the influx of traffic and keep their websites running smoothly. If a site isn't prepared for an overwhelming number of requests, it may end up with prolonged response times or even cause your website to fail. That, in turn, will negatively affect marketing data, search engine results pages ranking, and revenue. That's why business owners must understand the importance of scaling their websites to support traffic loads.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Optimizing high-traffic websites is a process that requires testing, adjusting, and monitor traffic to keep consistent site performance. Traffic levels change over time as you attract visitors, so your website must evolve to handle these changes. In order to prepare better and avoid scaling problems, it is good to know the three basic traffic levels:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Sites that get well under 100k requests a day. Most websites are at this level, and they are not technically challenging.</li><li>A website that gets around 100k-1M requests a day. At this level, scalability problems can appear.</li><li>Over 1M requests a day. This level is considered high website traffic.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There is no doubt that designing a system that supports hundreds of millions of users is not an easy task. That's why it is necessary to prioritize it from the start. You will gain lower maintenance costs, better user experience, and higher agility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2> Action Steps You Need to Take to Manage High Traffic</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As we already mentioned, increased traffic can slow down your site if not prepared for the traffic spike.<br>Here are some action steps you can take to handle an increased amount of web traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li> <strong>Compress your files. </strong>Large files slow down websites. Smaller files load faster and lower your overall load times.</li><li> <strong>Install a caching plugin. </strong>Caching creates static HTML versions of a website's content and reduces the number of requests, which can help your site manage heavy traffic. They play an essential role in speeding up a site, improving user experience, and reducing the burden on your server.&nbsp;</li><li> <strong>Make sure you are taking backups. </strong>Regular backup of your data is the only way to protect your data and recover your website after a security incident.</li><li> <strong>Make sure your applications and software are up to date.</strong> By keeping your applications and software up-to-date, you get access to the latest features and improve security and stability.&nbsp;</li><li> <strong>Optimize your Images.</strong> Image optimization refers to delivering high-quality images in the suitable format, dimension, size, and resolution while keeping the smallest possible size. Optimization improves page load speed, boosts websites' SEO ranking, and improves overall user experience.</li><li> <strong>Perform a regular SEO audit.</strong> By examining your website's content and identifying the best-performing and worst-performing posts and any broken links, you can often identify more minor issues that may impact the visitor experience.</li><li> <strong>Test it frequently. </strong>Frequent tests can identify elements that aren't working to be addressed as quickly as possible with minimal disruption.</li><li><strong> Upgrade your server.</strong> The right provider and hosting plan will offer enough power to ensure your site can handle heavy traffic and will also give you the stability of a static IP address.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At a time of fierce competition, converting your site visitors into leads and clients requires a specific combination of factors. Successful businesses know how to identify and meet user's expectations and achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction. Increased traffic is a sign of online success and a dream of any website manager. However, if you're not prepared for an increased number of visitors, peaks in online traffic can cause your website or app to slow down and ultimately crash. That can cost you money and undermine your credibility.</p>

<h5>by Katerina Bogdanoska</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the past years, outsourcing has become a crucial part of business management and a prime mover of business growth in many industries. <br>Outsourcing is an excellent strategic tool that offers multiple benefits like competitive access to skilled professionals. It provides costs reduction, reduced risk, and focus on core business activities. However, managing an outsourced team can be pretty challenging without effective strategies to ensure that work gets done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br>The idea of delegating essential tasks to a remote team may seem discouraging. After all, how can you ensure your team’s productivity isn’t affected when you’re in an entirely different location? In this article, we’ll show you that it’s possible. We prepared a list of nine things that you can do to increase your outsourced team productivity and keep them engaged and motivated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Create a clear organizational structure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Establishing a leadership hierarchy and clearly defining team roles and responsibilities is especially important when managing an outsourced team. Appointing an experienced project manager will ensure the project is completed on time and within budget. The right team structure will help you organize your workflow and maximize your time.<br>Communication becomes more straightforward. When your team knows what is expected of them, they cooperate more efficiently with fewer misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Communicate frequently&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[6411]} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1934154842.jpg" alt="" data-id="6411" data-link="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/?attachment_id=6411" class="wp-image-6411"/></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When&nbsp;you're managing an outsourced team, staying connected and communicating efficiently should be a<br>top priority. Often, when an outsourced project fails, it is not because of the team's lack of technical skills and competence but poor communication and coordination. That is why managers should encourage frequent contact between their in-house and outsourced teams. They should also encourage<br>their employees to express their opinions and make sure they feel like they're being heard. That creates a positive working environment and happy employees, and a happy team is a productive team. Without solid and regular conversations and discussions with your remote team, you reduce the opportunity to receive necessary feedback, which can affect teamwork. Good communication guarantees issues are resolved efficiently, problems limited, and results delivered as expected. It boosts morale and output, helps build trust, increases loyalty, and prevents significant matters. Luckily, there are many communication tools out there to facilitate communication with your outsourced team. Daily or weekly voice meetings or video calls is an effective way to get the team together to discuss updates and double-check that everyone remains on task.</p>

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Implement a flexible working schedule</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Supporting a flexible schedule gives employees the accountability, empowerment, and reassurance to focus on results rather than attendance. When they have control over their schedules, they can work when they feel the most energized and motivated, thus being more productive, focused, and quicker. Also, flexible working hours promote and facilitate a healthier work-life balance and, as a result, better performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Give feedback</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Providing feedback is necessary and beneficial, especially when the team works remotely. Ongoing feedback is the best way to let your employees know how they perform and what is expected from them. Clear and constructive feedback will help your remote team learn from their mistakes, build confidence and continuously improve. That will keep them motivated, engaged, and enthusiastic. Also, it fosters loyalty, boosts morale, and increases their productivity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Keep tasks simple</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[6412]} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1315769174.jpg" alt="" data-id="6412" data-link="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/?attachment_id=6412" class="wp-image-6412"/></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When the team is working on an important project, they can easily feel overwhelmed by the volume of the tasks they're responsible for completing. This feeling can make them feel overwhelmed, and the tasks seem insurmountable. The work is more manageable and less intimidating by providing clear, detailed instructions, setting priorities, and breaking the bigger project into smaller tasks. This critical process will help maintain productivity while managing an outsourced team. It will also enable thorough project progress tracking and ensure that work is completed on time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Promote continuous training and development</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Make constant training and development part of your outsourcing strategy. Your company is constantly changing, and that is why outsourced workers need to stay up-to-date with new products, services, or processes so they can deliver a consistent experience. Valuing and encouraging your employees' growth and personal development will make them feel supported and inspired at work, and they will naturally become more productive and satisfied with their work. Don't hesitate to invest in your team and equip them with the skills and knowledge needed to become top performers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Define clear objectives and expectations&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A healthy relationship with your outside team begins with defining clear goals and expectations. Make sure to communicate the vision and the goal for the project. Clarify expectations around measurable goals and how they align with organizational objectives. Explain each person's role in contributing toward making progress. That will ensure a successful project outcome and put you one step ahead of the competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Allow a learning curve</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> It is vital to allow your outsourced team to acquaint themselves with your products and services, gain competence in their work, and adopt the organizational culture. That will build their confidence and productivity, and over time, their skills will feel like second nature.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. Choose the Right Outsourcing Partner</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[6413]} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Capture-1024x681.png" alt="" data-id="6413" data-link="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/?attachment_id=6413" class="wp-image-6413"/></figure></li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software outsourcing means hiring an outside organization to complete all of the activities of a software development project instead of undertaking them in-house. When a company needs to reach its objectives faster, stay within budget, and build a competitive advantage, it requires a talented IT team to achieve that. Experienced outsourcing providers have the resources, talent, and expertise to build high-quality software. That is why companies worldwide are using this business strategy to grow their business by reducing operating costs and increasing the quality of services.</p>

The pandemic has forced many companies to cut costs and prioritize their digital transformation to support their business. The result is an increasing demand for outsourcing. Even businesses who had never considered this kind of service before have turned to it in these difficult times. More and more companies are keen on finding ways to reduce costs and overheads wherever they can. No matter what industry you're in, outsourcing services can help you find solutions that are right for your business and keep you afloat.</p>

<h2>How to Prepare Your Company for Outsourcing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you've already decided to outsource software development, you're probably wondering how to prepare before launching your collaboration with the service provider. Outsourcing is a business investment, so it is essential to have a clear plan and implementation strategy. You must be well prepared and know what you need before taking the first steps. In this article, we will provide you with some practical steps that you should take to build a successful outsourcing strategy. The steps before starting the project would usually include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Step 1: Define your goals</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> For a project to be successful, it is essential to clearly define the business goals you want to achieve through outsourcing. Your remote team needs to see the vision and the purpose of the project. Also, get them involved because there is a lot you can learn from their experience in these initial stages. This will help you determine how you structure and manage the project and ensure that the outsourcing team can meet your needs. Be as specific as possible and make a list of the items you want to outsource and how you want them to handle them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Step 2: Plan the budget</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> A carefully planned budget will determine how quickly you can complete the project, the level of skill you'll hire, and the types of technologies and equipment you can use. The more advanced the technology, the higher the development cost will be. The purpose of planning a development budget is to make sure that you're prepared for all possible situations. If you don't know exactly how much of your money is disposable income, it is very easy to let your spending out of control. Also, make sure you have money set aside for hidden costs that are very likely to come across.<br> An intelligent and structured budget planning will make all the difference to the growth of your business. It will also allow you to have the most productivity and efficiency while keeping overhead costs in check. In that way, your business remains profitable and successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Step 3: Document the requirements</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Inadequate specification of requirements can lead to failure of the software development. That how important it is. The requirements specification document serves as a map of the product you'll build and the features you want to include. That document will be used as a reference during software development and set clear targets for the teams. Without it is very unlikely that you will build the right product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Step 4: Choose the right outsourcing partner</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> As outsourcing is growing in popularity, especially in the last years, there are many software outsourcing companies on the market. Carefully select and create a list of providers who know your industry and have worked in it before. As a part of the outsourcing strategy, you will need to prepare questions to ask each provider. Thoroughly research the potential candidate's portfolios, past projects, customer reviews, and referrals. Ensure they have the right technical expertise and IT infrastructure that includes the latest hardware and software components. You should also review their hiring process; discuss the criteria they use to select a team specific to your business objectives and if they facilitate their training.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6450} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_407008072.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6450"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A trustworthy outsourcing partner with an IT background that meets your organization's unique technical needs will help you minimize the risks and establish solid ground for the project's overall success. The right outsourcing partner should be dedicated to helping your company<br>
succeed and grow, so consider all the influence factors before making your final decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Step 5: Choose the suitable outsourcing model</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> The outsourcing model that meets your project's requirements will depend on its complexity, budget, deadline, and level of involvement. There are three types you can choose from:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>The project-based model.</strong> - With this model, you fully delegate software development to an outsourcing company, from planning to release. After clarifying your complete project requirements, the project managers and business analysts from the outsourced team take full responsibility for forming the development team and the quality and performance of the project.</li><li> <strong>The dedicated team model.</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This model provides you with a remote software development team entirely dedicated to your product and business goals. The team will be chosen according to your demands. You can decide if they will report directly to you or assign the service provider's project manager to coordinate the communication process. With this model, you share the risks and responsibility for the quality of the product.</li><li> <strong>Staff augmentation model.</strong> - Staff augmentation or team extension model allows you to hire software development experts at any point of your project's cycle to fill talent gaps or speed up the delivery. They work remotely as part of your in-house tech team. This outsourcing strategy can be on a short, medium, or long-term basis and gives you more control over your project. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> If you need help deciding which outsourcing model covers all your needs, you can always contact <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/software-development/">Cosmic Development experts</a> and discuss your requirements. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Step 6: Assign roles and responsibilities</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Assign management roles and responsibilities early on will ensure that the work will run smoothly. In that way, your in-house and outsourced software developers will know whom they should report to and who needs to be updated about the progress of the projects. That, in turn, will eliminate confusion, create a more transparent workplace, and increases productivity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Step 7: Establish channels for communication</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Uninterrupted communication is vital for the success of a project, and it also requires a plan. Effective communication channels are crucial, especially when you and the outsourcing team don't share the same physical space, and should be discussed and agreed upon from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Invest in proper communication tools and establish a standard format of communication that will allow you to keep all of the information organized. Use project management tools like&nbsp;Jira&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a>, collaboration tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/edustart">Teams</a>,&nbsp;and messaging platforms like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a>. Email, chat, phone calls are all options. We live in a digital age, and there are countless excellent tools and software available. You have to find out what's best for your project. Whatever communication channel you choose, make sure it fits your project and helps you successfully operate with a fully remote team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Step 8: Be flexible</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keep in mind that a talented development team is an expert in their field. Be flexible enough to hear their ideas a creative solution they may offer.</p>

By implementing these eight steps, you'll systematically achieve your goals, you will save time and money, and mitigate risks and improve your project's delivery.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hiring software development talent has proven to be quite challenging in 2021. With the rise of technology and rapid digital transformation across businesses spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, rising customer expectations, and transition to remote work, the need and competition for skilled tech experts are proliferating. Whether back-end, front-end, or full-stack, software developers are the fundamental building blocks of any organization whose business operations rely on software. Today thousands of companies compete to recruit and retain from the limited pool of high-quality software developers. It is no wonder it is a costly and time-consuming process. This high demand is projected to continue in the coming years and grow 21% by 2028, as reported by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>What Does a Software Developer Do?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">First, let's clarify what a software developer does and why this profession is essential and sought-after.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In simple terms, a software developer, also known as a programmer or coder, uses programming languages to create computer software programs. An excellent software developer should be creative, have a passion for learning and development, and have excellent communication skills. Above all, it must have exceptional technical skills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although their duties and responsibilities may range depending on the type of organization and industry they work for, as well as their experience level, they are engaged in all stages of the software development life cycle and generally include tasks and responsibilities like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Gathering and evaluating user requirements</li><li>Creating efficient and clean code based on consumers' and clients' needs</li><li>Testing code</li><li>Fixing, maintaining, and improving existing software </li><li>Communication and collaboration with management and tech support colleagues</li><li>Compiling and assessing user feedback to improve software performance</li><li>Developing technical documentation for reference and reporting</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What Makes a Great Software Developer?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">

The best software developers of today have a good mix of technical proficiency and soft skills. They are able to figure out solutions to problems at any stage of the application development at any time. Beyond knowing programming languages and being excellent at writing code, there are other significant&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/five-personality-traits-for-novice-web-developers/" target="_blank">skills and qualities</a>&nbsp;outstanding software developers have in common. Here are the traits that can differentiate a great software developer from a good one and that can help you identify one that would make a great addition to your programming team:

</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Programming.png" alt="What makes a great developer" data-id="6476" data-link="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/?attachment_id=6476" class="wp-image-6476"/></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":25} -->
<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. <strong>Strong communication skills&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The capability to communicate complicated ideas clearly and precisely is essential in the development process. The developers should be capable of interacting with people and explaining themselves to non-technical stakeholders and other developers. They should convey and understand problems clearly, break down complicated ideas into simple concepts and propose solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. <strong>Quick learning and curiosity&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Acquiring new skills is essential for developers. Being a great software developer requires constant practice and dedication. Technology is the innovative branch that is constantly evolving, so developers must be curious, learn quickly and adapt; otherwise, they will be left behind. The best programmers have the ability to learn new languages and technologies quickly, process information, and above all are amazing self-learners. Successful programmers are willing to admit they don't know and are not afraid of new technology trends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. <strong>Broad technical experience</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Technical expertise is fundamental for software development. Technology is a broad field, and there are numerous tools, platforms, and languages a developer must master and integrate in order to make a good product or software. Professional software developers need a combination of technical skills to succeed. Here are some of the skills software developers are expected to have in 2021:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Cloud platforms</li><li>Programing languages like Python, C++, Java, and CSS</li><li>Data Structure and Algorithms</li><li>Database and SQL</li><li>Computer networks</li><li>Software testing</li><li>Operating System</li><li>SDLC (Software development life cycle)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keep in mind that this is no complete list, and you shouldn't expect that a good software developer has experience in working with all these technologies; however, it provides a good starting point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. <strong>Team player</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The ability to help teammates when there are stuck and teach them new skills is a quality of top software developers. Teamwork is crucial for software development, especially in cases when the project has time and budget constraints. When developers on your team lean on each other, the success of the project is inevitable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. <strong>Time management</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Time management is a valuable skill that every aspiring software developer should develop. The ability to use time effectively and efficiently increases focus and productivity. Plus, it reduces distractions and procrastination and lowers stress. A great software developer has a strong work ethic and organizational skills and respect deadlines. Time management is a significant factor in software development because it can influence the outcome of the whole project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. <strong>Business sense</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When combined with technical expertise, business acumen can be a great advantage. Business-savvy developers understand how the business works. They are able to analyze business problems and make quick, precise, and profitable decisions, and deliver technology-focused on customers' needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><strong>How to Hire the Best Software Developers?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Most businesses today depend on software development and the people behind it. Hiring the best software developers is one of the biggest technical challenges for today's recruiters. Software development is a complex and fast-paced field, and the people you hire determine the success of your project. The selection process can be a laborious, slow, and expensive process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you are a company that needs fast access to talented developers that will fit your team, drive your success, and provide you with a competitive advantage, you need to look beyond traditional hiring practices. Outsourcing software development is a cost-effective and flexible solution that can save the headache of talent shortage and bad hires. The right outsourcing partner can help you find highly skilled candidates fast. It will support growth without the need for significant investments in new hires, technologies, and IT infrastructure.</p>

<h4>1. You recently celebrated your 5th work anniversary in Cosmic Development. So first of all, congratulations, and let us say we are thrilled to have you on the team! In that spirit, could you tell us the story of how you joined the Cosmic family?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">First, let me thank you for your congratulations and especially for the fantastic gift you sent me for my fifth anniversary. I wasn't expecting that at all. I am so happy to have such helpful and thoughtful coworkers and managers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My career path in Cosmic Development started at the beginning of 2016. At first, I was mentored by the more experienced colleagues who unselfishly shared their knowledge with me. I am thankful beyond words for the advice and support they gave me and how they assisted me in going outside of my comfort zone and being the best version of myself every day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I love working at Cosmic Development, which fosters a positive work environment where everyone feels safe, engaged, motivated, and productive. An environment where employees are valued and recognized for their excellent work and where they can unleash their full potential.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>2. What is the most challenging part of your job? Can you describe how you approach the challenges you face as a web developer?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The challenges I come across daily are approximately the same challenges you face in almost every profession in this industry - task prioritizing, time management, staying on top of the new technologies. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, if you ask me about the technical challenges I have faced so far, I can mention a few, but the most important one would be not having a standardized development process. This happens when more people work on a project, and everybody delivers a product that meets the requirements but uses a different approach. That results in a far more complex and time-consuming process than it should be. The solution, of course, would be identifying the issue and standardizing the processes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>3. In your opinion, what are the top technical skills needed to be a successful web developer?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is obvious; you must be familiar with HTML and CSS. JavaScript is also at the top of the list of necessary web developer skills and qualifications. A web developer can use a source control system to track, regulate, and revise code changes. Git is an excellent example of an open-source version control system that allows you to identify and rectify errors quickly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another crucial skill for a web developer is Testing and Debugging. It might be considered a time-consuming and complicated process, but for me, it's like solving a puzzle, and slight alterations can make everything work. Of course, besides object-oriented programming (OOP), I'd add Libraries and Frameworks, which are critical elements for developing a more organized project. As a crucial factor, I would also mention Web Optimization and Teamwork and Time Management (or Project Management), which are vital.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>4. Tell us more about your expertise and how do you hone your skills?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As I mentioned earlier, thanks to the mentorship of my senior colleagues, I can advance my skills and knowledge. The short courses we often organize, the informal discussions we have during break time, or the online meetings we now have during the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic helped me&nbsp;develop my skills over time. Teamwork is an invaluable learning experience for me. When we work on big projects, we learn a lot from each other- professionally and personally. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another rewarding way to learn, teach, share, and build experience is through open-source projects. I often find some open-source projects and create my version. As we turned to remote working and online learning, I also found inspiration watching YouTube videos by interesting tech content creators. One example is Povilas Korop, an experienced developer and YouTuber who shares invaluable Laravel tips and tricks, tutorials, and demo projects with the Laravel framework. In the end, I would add&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">WPBeginner</a>&nbsp;as a great source of inspiration and learning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>5. What are you working on right now?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In all these years at Cosmic Development, I’ve had the chance to work on different projects that required the use of various technologies and services. I started with building WordPress themes, development plugins, restful API services, then on to implementation, optimization, and maintenance of the implemented services. Later I started working with specific PHP frameworks like Laravel, Codeigniter, Yii…. This basically means that my day-to-day work is based on PHP, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Throughout the projects, I’ve encountered many challenges that helped me grow as a developer. Currently, I am working on a lengthy project in which we develop a product for a distinguished company. However, I can’t give you more details because of the product development non-disclosure agreement. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are also preparing for DIGIT (Design and Interactive Graphics in IT), which is an educational workshop for students in the field of design and programming. There, we will share our expertise and hands-on experience with the teams taking part.</p>

<h4>6. Why events like DIGIT are important, and who is it for?&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Digit is a workshop that is of great importance to all participants, i.e., students, mentors, and organizers. It is a great event where people can exchange knowledge and experiences and network with like-minded individuals from the IT community. </p>

<h4>You are one of the newest additions to the Cosmic Development team. Could you tell us how your Cosmic journey began?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I embarked on my career journey with Cosmic Development about a year and a half. It all started on LinkedIn. The conversation there led to a video interview, and the whole process resulted in me getting hired as a senior software developer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I like my Cosmic journey so far, and most of all, I enjoy the freedom and flexibility the company offers. I've got a lot of support from the team, and I can't wait to meet everyone in person soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>We would like to know why you opted for software development and why Angular exactly?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software development is not always easy, but it is rewarding, fun, and engaging. Building software is more than writing code - it is providing solutions for users’ problems, and therefore it requires creativity, innovation, and problem-solving skills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I like the feeling of achievement when I come up with solutions, and I am never bored when I work. Also, I love the potential of teamwork in software development. Being a part of a team and combining different points of view, experiences and skills lead to practical solutions to problems. We learn a lot from each other. I’ve learned a lot through indie development, where you go on your own, build something, and sell it to the world. So, I guess the vast potential for creative expression, sharing ideas, and collaboration with other developers, and above all, the passion I have for development, were essential to why I chose software development as a career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And to answer the question about Angular. There are many reasons behind choosing Angular for web development. It offers a variety of features, programming styles, good documentation, google maintenance, package ecosystem, developer tooling, fast performance, stability and compatibility, and a learning curve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->
<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>What were the biggest challenges that you faced as a software developer?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are working in a highly complex, vast, and dynamic industry, and software development is an essential part of that industry. Several factors are determining it, including growing complexities, market conditions, changing technology trends, and expanding software development challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Of course, the challenges may vary. For example, most of the projects are now increasingly ruled by the “build once, deploy everywhere” paradigm, which means that a single application can run across multiple platforms. Integrating different programs and maintaining support complicates this issue even further.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, for me personally, being up to date and not becoming obsolete is the most important thing to do in order to rise up to the challenges the industry brings.</p>

<h4>What are the crucial things a software developer shall do to stay ahead of their game?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One shall face all obstacles without giving up. Persistence, positive mental attitude, and passion distinguish good from great software developers. Having endurance keeps your discipline, optimism and helps you persevere through difficult situations and challenges. Also, you have to be naturally curious, love to learn new things, and work hard. I believe that self-learners make the best programmers. Other vital traits I would mention are attention to detail and accepting feedback. Positive criticism is essential for growing, learning, and improving.</p>

<h4>While we are discussing staying ahead of your game, can you tell us what your favorite books or podcasts on software development are?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I will start with books, and my first choice would be&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/"><em>Eloquent JavaScript</em></a> by&nbsp;Marjin Haverbeke. <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em>&nbsp;is a book that really stands out in a market saturated with programming content for developers. Having said that, I wouldn’t recommend it to beginners. It has some specific parts that require a few years of coding background to understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Next, I would list&nbsp;<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2998152-javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a></em> by Douglas Crockford. This one helped me “think in JavaScript” and helped me understand how to use the best parts of JS and bypass the bad parts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For podcasts, I will mention <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://javascriptjabber.com/" target="_blank"><em>JavaScript Jabber</em></a> - one of the best-established JavaScript podcasts. And one of the must-see episodes is the interview with Brendan Eich, the man behind the JavaScript programming language.</p>

<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>You recently represented Cosmic Development at the DIGIT event organized by the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje. Can you tell us a bit more about that experience?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6620} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blue-and-Gray-Online-Doctor-Consultation-Instagram-Post-32-1024x1024.png" alt="developer - Cosmic Development " class="wp-image-6620"/></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Yes, I was part of this year’s DIGIT- Angular 2021. It was a fresh experience for me, and it is a great idea. However, I believe there is much room for improvement, and the best way to do so is through getting constructive feedback from all sides.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Generally, it is an excellent way for the students to gain a realistic idea of what it is like to work on real projects and share ideas and solutions to a given problem, of course, with our help, as mentors. There should be more such events.<br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2021 was a challenging, unusual, and fantastic year. Here's a recap of what Cosmic Development accomplished in 2021.</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As we are coming to the end of another challenging year, we reflect on everything we have accomplished in 2021. Despite all challenges, we at Cosmic Development successfully adapted to the rapid changes brought about by the new reality of life and doing business. During the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we showed resilience, flexibility, and compassion and supported our people and clients through uncertainties and unpredictability. We continued working hard and provided our clients with high-quality services and innovative solutions. And we proudly say that we have seen some excellent results. To wrap up the year, let's look back at some highlights of 2021.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">This year, we've marked the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/celebration-of-success-ten-years-of-outsourcing-tech-talent/" target="_blank">first decade for Cosmic Development</a>. What began with a small team of six young and passionate people slowly grew into a larger crew. Today we are a renowned international IT outsourcing company with over 200 highly skilled and dedicated professionals. We have over 300 completed projects with over 90 clients around the globe. In the past ten years, we kept on our growth path. We established ourselves as a global provider of skills, knowledge, and expertise, offering a wide range of digital outsourcing solutions. Even though we had a virtual party, we can't wait to celebrate this important milestone in the good old-fashioned way by gathering our people from all locations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">If this year has taught us anything, it is that uncertainty and progress can exist together.

We have achieved this by utilizing our core skills and providing services that add value for our clients. Next, we implemented strategies and innovations that drove the company forward and led us to a better future.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Sports events.</strong>&nbsp;Our commitment to healthy life choices and wellbeing has always been a part of our company culture.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Traditionally, every year we take part in Christmas and New Year charitable initiatives. This year we supported nonprofits and charities in Macedonia and Serbia. We helped 30 families and donated food, clothing, and money to children without parents, children with disabilities, and low-income families. Additionally, we responded to the call to donate IT equipment and computers to families who can't afford it and joined the "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://donirajkompjuter.mk/">Donate a computer"</a>&nbsp;initiative. The donation is going to be realized in the first week of January.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>Developing a high-quality code while staying productive can be quite challenging. Here are some valuable tips that can help you boost your productivity without compromising on work-life balance.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Completing tasks quickly and efficiently without sacrificing quality is what it means to be productive. Being productive is an essential aspect of any industry or area of expertise. Still, it can be a real game-changer in a complex and tech-centric industry like software development. A developer's job is one of the most complicated and mentally demanding professions, and staying productive is not an easy task. They work with complex algorithms and juggle multiple tasks. Adopting a healthy work ethic and habits and making minor adjustments will lead to lasting changes and increase their productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This article shares some handy productivity tips to help developers enhance their efficiency while boosting productivity levels.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. <strong>Put a schedule in your flexible schedule&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Flexible working hours or work from home can be incredible, but it comes with its own set of challenges. It can be difficult to focus, especially if other family members or distractions are present during your working hours. To stay organized, you need to set some rules and have a productivity plan that will allow you to get the best out of your day. Scheduling daily tasks will measure your progress and manage your time effectively. The best results always come with proper planning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Find your most productive hours and decide when to start and finish your workday. Be consistent. Set realistic goals and prioritize your most critical task first thing in the morning (or whenever you start your workday), when your energy and willpower are at their highest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Take planned breaks away from the screen. They are essential to your productivity and well-being and boost your creativity and motivation. Analyze your workspace and make adjustments to help you work better and quicker. Finally, don't forget the good old eating and sleeping right, staying physically active, and making time to socialize.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">All these habits will help you maintain a healthy work-life balance and allow you to have more time for personal activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. <strong>Keep away distractions and stop wasting time</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A focused developer is a productive developer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6728} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cosmic-News-Bulletin-December-Edition-3-1-1024x577.jpg" alt="developer - productivity tips " class="wp-image-6728"/><figcaption>Source: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another way to describe productivity is getting complex tasks done with minimal distractions or interruptions. Developing software is a demanding job, and it's not easy to maintain focus and concentration when there are so many distractions around you. Every distraction affects the quality of your work and can result in a mistake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It takes only a few seconds to get out of the flow, but you will need over 23 minutes on average to get back on task after an interruption and into the flow again. Moreover, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206014318/https:/www.cc.gatech.edu/~vector/papers/sqj.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Georgia Institute of Technology study</a> states that a software developer will need between 10-15 minutes to recover from distractions and resume work. That is why learning to deal with distraction and decide what is essential and non-essential is a must for every developer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your typical distractions could be answering emails, browsing through social media, phone calls, being in a busy work office, etc. It may not be easy to let go, but think of all the time you can save.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Some of the ways to help you cope with interruptions include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Put your phone in silent mode during working hours</li><li>Turn off social media notifications</li><li>Turn off email alerts</li><li>Create an auto-response to text messages</li><li>Learn to say NO</li><li>Don't multitask. Focus on one task at a time</li><li>Set a social media blocker on your computer browser</li><li>Have specified times for answering emails, messages</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These changes will not only increase your productivity but will also prevent you from getting mentally exhausted.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. <strong>Use the right platforms and tools</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Team collaboration tools, project management, time tracking, automation, or tools that help you avoid distractions. Developers can use various tools and platforms to speed up their work and maximize productivity and efficiency. Here are some that you can check out:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Distraction canceling software tools: Escape, Cold Turkey, Dewo, or Freedom.</li><li>Bug tracking tools:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bit.ly/2UtdeuZ" target="_blank">BackLog</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mantisbt.org/" target="_blank">MantisBT</a></li><li>Code searching tools such as&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher" target="_blank">The Silver Searcher</a></li><li>Time tracking tools like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hubstaff.com/" target="_blank">Hubstaff</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://get.jibble.io/time-tracking-for-teams/" target="_blank">Jibble</a></li><li>Project management tools like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://monday.com/" target="_blank">Monday.com</a>, Trello, Jira, Asana, Wrike</li><li>Team collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>, Trello,&nbsp;<a href="https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/go/collaboration-tools-clickup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">ClickUp</a></li><li>Code management tools: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, GitLab, Bitbucket</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Additionally, you can try&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://habitica.com/static/home" target="_blank">Habitica</a>, a habit-building and productivity app that allows you to treat your work or tasks as a role-playing game, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zty.pe/" target="_blank">ZType</a>, a game that helps you practice your typing speed and accuracy. Finally, you can relax with some music and visit the website&nbsp;<a href="https://musicforprogramming.net/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">musicforProgramming</a>&nbsp;intended for listening to ambient music while programming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is only a fraction of the productivity options available. Do your research and choose based on your individual needs and preferences.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. <strong>Take breaks and get some rest</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110208131529.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Studies</a>&nbsp;have shown that taking breaks and brief rests throughout the day leads to higher productivity, job satisfaction and improves your overall well-being. It can also:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Boost creativity</li><li>Help you focus</li><li>Improve mental health</li><li>Process and retain information better</li><li>Reduce stress</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6733} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shutterstock_1844075641-1-1.jpg" alt="productivity tips - stretching " class="wp-image-6733"/><figcaption> Source: Shutterstock </figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The&nbsp;<a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Pomodoro Technique</a>&nbsp;is a straightforward way to remind yourself to take regular breaks. This technique, popular among the developer community, is a time management method that breaks down your work at intervals - 25 minutes sessions, followed by short 5-minute breaks. Every four 25-minute sessions take a more extended 20-30 minutes' break. Will it work for you? Go ahead and try.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">So, go on, give your eyes a break from the screen. Stand up, stretch, get some water, walk around, and chat with your friends or colleagues. When you return to your work mentally and physically refreshed, you can stay focused on your task and do better work.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Automate repetitive tasks</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another excellent productivity hack is to take full advantage of automation. Automating time-consuming and monotonous tasks will save you hours of coding and will simplify your job in a way that significantly improves productivity.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. <strong>Keep learning&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you want to stay productive, you must constantly update your skills. As you gain more experience and expand your knowledge, you become a better problem solver, faster and more efficient. Plus, you learn how to be more productive and what methods and practices are best for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6734} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Invest in yourself and your knowledge. Explore new tools that will help ease and speed up your workflow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">An excellent way for professional growth is to work on hobby projects or participate in the development of open-source projects. You will learn many new tricks, keep your mind fresh and grow as a programmer. Listen to podcasts or audiobooks while exercising, commuting, cooking, or cleaning. Read books and blogs, complete courses, or talk to mentors. There are more than enough options available to keep up to date in the fast-moving world of programming and development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. <strong>Final thoughts</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Implementing the strategies above will take time. Developing a healthy productivity plan is a long process that requires consistency, resilience, commitment, and patience. Once it becomes your habit, you will see a significant difference. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">But there is no one-size-fits-all approach to time management and productivity. Everyone has a unique personality and working style. What works for one developer could be a total failure for another. Hopefully, this article will spur you to find an approach that works the best for you and will help you boost your productivity and efficiency. The benefits are manifold - being qualified for <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/careers/">new job opportunities</a>, higher pay for delivering quality work with less effort,  better work-life balance, and internal satisfaction. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>Vojkan Boshkovski, a Senior Software Developer, talks about his experience and role at Cosmic Development.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6773,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In our ongoing "Employee Spotlight" blog series, we shine a light on the talented individuals that comprise Cosmic Development's team. We want to learn more about their roles, experience, background, and what it's like working at Cosmic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today we introduce one of our senior software developers, Vojkan Boshkovski. Vojkan has over five years of experience in software development and is proficient in PHP, Laravel, and MySQL. He has been a crucial part of Cosmic Development for almost a year and brings knowledge and professionalism to the team. We value his hard work and are happy to have him on board.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As part of the dynamic team of Bookmark (from which we already had the chance to talk to <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/the-responsibilities-of-a-chief-technology-officer/">Atanas</a>, <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-a-vp-of-engineering-can-lead-a-diverse-life/">Petar</a>, and <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/remote-agile-teams-management-success-story/">Maja</a>), his primary responsibilities include writing well-designed and efficient code and code reviews. He also participates in team brainstorming sessions to discuss developing, improving, or modifying the existing products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this interview, Vojkan talks about his beginning at Cosmic, his role and responsibilities, and what it's like to be part of <a href="https://www.bookmark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bookmark.com</a>, one of Cosmic Development's most valuable and loyal clients. He also shares some advice on what it takes a software developer to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here's what he had to say:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Vojkan, you joined Cosmic Development a year ago. Can you tell us how your journey began?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I've been hearing great things about Cosmic Development throughout the years but never got the chance to apply for a job. Then, a colleague of mine that worked for Cosmic's Bookmark team told me about a job opening, for which I immediately applied. The interview went smoothly, and the people were friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable —  a perfect fit for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong><strong>You are part of one of the biggest teams at Cosmic Development, Bookmark. Can you tell us something about that experience?</strong></strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bookmark is a big and complex project built using modern technologies. It is a privilege to contribute, and there is much to learn from it. The application has a vast and active user base, which adds to every task's complexity (and enjoyment). Working in a big team of all seniors is pretty great, especially when they are all nice and collaborative. It's been great from day 1. We spend a lot of time brainstorming and pair programming that helps our bonds grow stronger. <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-to-scale-your-business-interview-with-bookmarks-ceo-and-founder-david-kosmayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The upper management</a> is very understanding and knowledgeable as well. I would say that anyone would be happy to work in this environment.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Any pivotal moments you have had on your career path? Do you have any advice to give to younger colleagues?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Choosing Laravel as the leading technology was a good decision for me. The framework is kept up to date and has a very active and big community. It can be used for projects of any size (small to enterprise) with a proper setup. I strongly recommend using Laravel (or Symfony) for people who choose PHP as their primary programming language. And, for those who chose a different language, I would recommend switching to PHP. :) Also, educating yourself to the point of becoming language-agnostic would be my advice to any developer. It is one of the requirements to becoming a software architect for those who chose that carrier path, of course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What are the crucial things a software developer shall do to stay ahead of their game?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As I previously mentioned, being as language-agnostic as you can is very important, in my opinion. That includes reading a lot of software development books and having a lot of working experience on real-life projects. Do not get stuck on a single project for too many years if you can. There are exceptions, but generally, I would try to work on as many different kinds of projects as possible. Be an active member and contributor for your chosen stack and follow discussions on upcoming changes. This will help you think and plan ahead, detect early deprecations and breaking changes, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>While we discuss staying ahead of your game, can you tell us what your favorite books or podcasts on software development are?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">'The pragmatic programmer' is my all-time favorite. Of course, 'Clean code' is worth mentioning as a must-read. Other than those, I would say any book on OOP, design, and architectural patterns is worth reading.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://24hr.mk/">24HR.mk</a> is the first Macedonian portal for human resources, where you will find the latest information from the world of HR.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a target="_blank" href="https://24hr.mk/cosmic-development-edna-od-prvite-kompanii-na-makedonskiot-it-pazar-koja-im-dava-celosna-sloboda-i-fleksibilnost-na-vrabotenite/?fbclid=IwAR0KCrq3vg7ORJOaShz12_-2yMe27S9xk1Bf3g9RKolAM7-V-iQ_kiXM68Y" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here</a>&nbsp;you can read the original article in Macedonian as published by 24HR.mk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Cosmic Development - one of the first companies in the Macedonian IT market that gives complete freedom and flexibility to its employees</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6835,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8668-1170x800-2-1024x700.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6835"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our employees have a full right to plan their workday as it suits them most, depending on their productivity. And they can work from wherever they want. We do not practice fixed working hours with a strictly defined beginning and end of work; we do not practice exhausting daily reports and similar practices. Instead, we give complete flexibility to our employees to work when they consider themselves the most concentrated, most productive, and most energetic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development is an IT company founded in 2011 with headquarters in Canada. What's quite important is that it is one of the first companies of its kind in Macedonia that has prosperously completed the first decade of its existence and continues with its success story. Cosmic Development currently has three more offices; two in Macedonia - in Skopje and Bitola, and one in Serbia - in Belgrade. We talk about the success story in Skopje with Andriana Popovska, Human Resources Manager at Cosmic Development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Tell us something more about Cosmic Development?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The company provides outsourcing of all kinds of IT services. The clients we work with and deliver our services to are from different countries. Still, our primary focus is on working with clients from the United States and Canada. Besides our main scope - outsourcing of IT services, to a lesser extent, our company also outsources non-technical services and functions: such as digital marketing, customer support, writing articles for clients' needs (content writing), photo-editing, photo-processing, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6838,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-1024x536.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6838"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Freedom and flexibility are the two essential things that define you as a company. What does this mean for your employees?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">That's right, the two most recognizable features of Cosmic Development are the complete freedom and flexibility that are given to all employees from their first day of employment, regardless of their position and location. We are happy that we are distinguished and stand out for these two things in a way. Freedom and flexibility in our work exist and have been enjoyed for many years, and we didn't introduce them because of the pandemic with Covid-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6839,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Open-Positions-2-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6839"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">What does that mean?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">That means that employees have a full right to plan their workday as it suits them most, according to their productivity, and they can work from wherever they want. We do not practice fixed working hours with a strictly defined beginning and end of work; we do not practice exhausting daily reports and similar practices. Instead, we give complete flexibility to our employees to work when they consider themselves the most concentrated, most productive, and most energetic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I will mention again that our company was one of the first on the Macedonian market which, in addition to flexible working hours, had introduced the benefit of remote work, for employees to enjoy the opportunity to work where they want.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Reliable and high-quality execution of the work assignments is most important to us as a company and freeing our employees from unnecessary norms. As long as the working hours are full, the results of the delivered work are of top quality, and our clients are satisfied, it does not matter what part of the day the employee worked and whether he does it from the office, beach, cafe, park, even from another country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6840,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-1024x536.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6840"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Of course, there are exceptions, like in a situation when the project's goal requires specific meetings, teamwork, etc. But even in these cases, we practice and strive for them to be announced to our employees ahead so that they can plan their workday and time accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The freedom and flexibility provided to this extent also entail great confidence that the employer should have in its employees. As a company, we believe in every employee, their work, and their dedication. So far, we have realized that not only are these benefits not abused but they are also appreciated and respected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Has Covid-19 changed how you work in your company and how did you adapt to the new normal?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Since teleworking and flexible working hours existed before the pandemic, we didn't notice any significant changes and didn't have to take any special adaptation measures. We would rather say that, like everyone else, we faced uncertainty in the whole situation rather than changes in the way we worked. And, of course, we stayed connected through a range of activities and challenges that we organized for our employees, especially during the mandatory isolation period. You can read more about our creative way to spend quality time together and outside of work&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/cosmic-beats-isolation/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The benefit of distance working and flexibility made it possible not to notice a single day of downtime. There were no negative consequences for the employees or the company. At the same time, we provided our employees with maximum protection from the virus without disturbing the typical workflow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We still work from home, but our offices are open for our employees (e.g., if one of our employees wants to work from the office, if someone has technical problems, for meetings, etc.) by following all measures and protocols for protection of course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6841,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/0-02-05-1a21245de48cd928a2f174b5afc5001c26a52a8955d80d584bdc131d38ea11fb_6e36752750d9f31d-1232x1536-1-821x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6841"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Did it affect the recruitment and employment process?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In terms of a negative outcome - not at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It turned out that the company was ahead of its time and introduced measures/options before they became mandatory. Thanks to the flexibility and remote work, the transition from office work to 100% work from home in a pandemic occurred naturally, without problems and side effects. On the contrary, I would say that the recruitment exploded during the last and this year. We constantly have new vacancies for which we actively recruit highly qualified staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>What are the plans of Cosmic Development for the future?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are many plans 😊; we have to admit that some of them depend on the whole situation with Covid-19. We strive to achieve them, but the health and safety of our employees always come first. Our priority is to continue on the upward line, both in the number of clients and projects, as well as in the number of new colleagues and of course retention and cooperation with existing ones.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the ever-changing job market, you can't solely rely on hard skills to succeed. Today, many employers expect web developers to have hybrid skills, i.e., a combination of hard and soft skills. If you want to stay competitive and expand the professional competency that will allow you to perform your job well, you must focus on developing both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hard skills are indispensable to perform the technical tasks of your job successfully and are a must for any web development role. They are the technical knowledge gained through education and training, and they can be slightly different based on whether you're a full-stack, frontend, or backend developer. They are easily measured and specific to the job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the other hand, soft skills or people skills are harder to define and measure and are universal. They refer to the inherent abilities or behavioral traits that can tell how you communicate with your colleagues, interact with company leadership, react under pressure or overcome obstacles.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/top-soft-skills-for-software-developers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soft skills</a>&nbsp;set apart ideal from adequate candidates and can be game-changer when you apply for a job. Their role becomes even more critical now as technology and artificial intelligence advance, and the world needs professionals with strong, soft skills to thrive in an automated world.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Top 5 Hard Skills for Web Developers</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>HTML</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - is a core technology for building Web pages, and it is the backbone of every website. This basic markup language describes the structure and content of web pages and web applications, and every aspiring web developer must understand HTML, be it frontend or backend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>CSS</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language that defines HTML code's visual look and presentation. In other words, it is the extension to the HTML that controls the layout of the elements on the webpages and is responsible for the font, format, colors on the page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">JavaScript is a prevalent and widely used scripting language for web development, and it is the core technology of modern websites. JavaScript allows you to change HTML and CSS elements making a website more interactive, dynamic, and engaging. This involves videos or interactive maps, menus, and search bars, among other things. By learning JavaScript, you can meet the higher expectations from your clients in the web development process and provide a pleasant user experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These three programming languages are the foundation of any website and essential building blocks for web and app development, so learning them is crucial for every developer. When you know the basics choosing a specialization should be your next step. Decide if you want to be a frontend, backend, or full-stack developer and learn languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby, or tools like jQuery, a JavaScript library, JS frameworks like Angular, Vue.js, or React, as well as front end frameworks like Bootstrap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Testing and debugging</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Every web developer should know how to test and debug their code. Testing and debugging are important activities during the development and maintenance process and should be done regularly. In that way, you'll ensure that the code is functioning correctly, thus creating a positive user experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Search engine optimization</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Search engine optimization (SEO) is another vital aspect of designing websites. Creating visually appealing and technically proficient websites but ignoring SEO basics will result in poorer traffic and conversion rates. Since it is crucial for the success of companies, it is highly recommended that Web Developers master SEO skills and develop SEO-friendly and competitive websites. Knowledge of SEO will boost your resume and make you a great web developer who understands the web perfectly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Top 5 Soft Skills for Web Developers</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Adaptability and flexibility</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Web Developers should be able to adapt to changes and new situations quickly. Adaptable web developers are open, learn new skills, and respond rapidly to changing ideas, responsibilities, trends, and expectations. Such flexibility is beneficial and highly valued in the unpredictable world of web development projects and changing clients' needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Communication</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a web developer, you will often collaborate with many teams and groups and interact with people who are not tech-savvy, so you must communicate complex ideas and technical concepts in a simple and straightforward language. That is why it is crucial to practice developing your communication skills, including writing, reading, listening, and speaking. Successful communication leads to successful web development projects, reducing the gap between the requirement and the final product. It saves time, reduces errors, and creates a better work environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Learning and openness to new technologies</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The world of web development is a fast-moving industry that is constantly evolving and changing. What is common practice today might become outdated in a few years. If you want to be a superb web developer and stay ahead of the curve in the competitive market, you have to keep up with the trends and learn new technologies and programming languages. Stay persistent and never stop learning. Use the countless resources available to you and learn something new every day — you won't regret it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Problem-solving</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Problem-solving skills involve quickly identifying the underlying issues and implementing practical and intelligent solutions. Web development is all about problem-solving, from fixing bugs to figuring out how to implement the best design. If you want to be a superb web developer, you need to develop your problem-solving skills early in your professional life. The best way to improve these skills is through practice. Familiarize yourself with common industry issues and learn from more experienced employees. Practice focusing on defining a problem, keep things simple, learn from your more experienced colleagues and the many online resources available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Time management&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Web developers often work on multiple projects simultaneously, keep up with deadlines, manage demanding clients, keep up with industry trends, and strive to have a fulfilling and healthy personal life at the same time. That can be stressful and challenging. Poor time management skills can affect the quality of your work, make you miss deadlines, and lose clients. To stay efficient and healthy, it is crucial to have a time management strategy. To do that, you must learn how to plan ahead, set priorities, forget about multitasking, and use time management techniques like the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pomodoro Technique</a>.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Providing constructive feedback is essential to developers' success and performance. When given or received correctly, it creates a healthy environment and boosts developers' productivity and engagement. It also clarifies expectations, reinforces positive behavior, and addresses problem areas. Well-delivered feedback is also fundamental to the success of any company or organization as it becomes a catalyst for change and a point of reference for improvement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">But giving constructive feedback can be a tricky area to navigate, especially when it comes to input for negative actions or results. Poorly delivered feedback, be it positive or negative, may hurt developers' performance and leave them demotivated and discouraged. Having that in mind, managers and team leaders must learn to give feedback the right way. To do that, they should plan their approach and set some ground rules that will benefit both the organization and the employees.</p>

<h2><strong>Tips on how to provide constructive feedback to developers</strong></h2>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here are some useful tips to help you structure and deliver constructive feedback to your development team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Plan ahead</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Planning and preparing are crucial parts of giving constructive feedback. Set baseline expectations early on and follow their progress carefully. And always remember that effective feedback is corrective and not critical. Here are some things you should consider:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Review previous feedback sessions.</li><li>Go over your task management system like Trello, JIRA, or Monday, to see what tasks they have worked on.</li><li>Observe your employees during daily sessions.</li><li>Write down as many observations as possible.</li><li>Create clear and measurable goals.</li><li>Determine what is worth sharing.</li><li>Come up with suggestions.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":20} -->
<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Ask permission</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before you give feedback, make sure you ask permission first. By doing that, you approach the person with respect and provide them with time to prepare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, you can say: "Would you mind if I gave you some feedback?", "Is this a good time to share some feedback with you?" or "I'd like to give you some feedback. Is that okay with you?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In that way, you can deliver feedback when they are more receptive to listen to it and feel more in control over the situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Be specific and objective</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The more exact the feedback is, the more useful it will be. Provide facts and specific examples of good and bad performance. Unless there is evidence to back them up, you should avoid giving opinions and judgments. Software Developers are more likely to respond to objective and specific feedback when they know what aspect of the project you are talking about, what went wrong, and what can be improved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Example: "You are an excellent team leader" can be replaced with something like "I want to thank you for demonstrating optimism in the face of uncertainty at the meeting this afternoon. The numbers were worrying, but you set the tone for the rest of the team. I'm impressed by it, and I want to tell you to keep up the good work."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Be timely</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Developers should receive feedback as soon as possible and at regular intervals throughout the year. Providing feedback immediately following an event such as work product submission or presentation will significantly impact performance. You shouldn't wait for a quarterly or yearly review to address specific issues because they may multiply by a domino effect if left unaddressed. Regular feedback will help you track and analyze your developer's overall job performance much easier, and it will help the developers recognize areas of strengths and weakness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Create solutions together</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">You should listen to the developers' point of view and allow them to offer solutions, even if you have particular solutions in mind. Be open to their ideas, and don't forget to let them be part of the problem-solving process. You will also learn a lot from their perspective and maybe understand the root cause of the problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the end, provide your suggestions and explain the positive results they will lead to. Ask questions and see if they received your message and know the next steps. Lastly, encourage your development team to provide feedback about your performance and role as a manager. Then, discuss openly and try finding a way to make it work and use the feedback effectively.</p>

<h3><strong>Giving negative feedback in a positive way - examples</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When giving feedback, you should think carefully about the language you will use and the expressions you choose to avoid misunderstanding and hurting someone's feelings. Here are more positive and negative examples of delivering feedback:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Instead of saying, "You keep missing deadlines, and that impacts the rest of the team and the project.", you can use "I've noticed you are struggling with time management. Is there anything I can do to help?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Or, "You haven't met your targets. I think that is going to affect the team's performance." It can be replaced with "You haven't met your targets, but I know that you are working hard. Are there any barriers in your way that I can help with?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Follow these five guidelines, and you will get better and more comfortable giving feedback, and your employees will be more open to receiving it.</p>

<h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Remember, providing developers with continuous and constructive feedback is one of the most powerful performance enhancement tools at your disposal. The final goal is not only to improve the developers' work performance over the long term, but it will also lead to your company's long-term success.</p>

<p><strong><em>What started as a concept turned into multiplied success stories!</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When Cosmic Development was founded back in 2011, it was based on the principle of helping businesses of various sizes grow. All by providing the best tech talent solutions tailored to every client’s needs and budget. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">But that’s the one side of the story. The other and not that widespread story is that Cosmic Development has strived to establish itself as a modern and prosperous workplace from day one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After over a decade-long tenure, we are looking back on several inspirational employee stories at our company.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>From Tech Internships to Fulfilling Careers </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>From Intern to CTO - Vladimir Novachki</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Novacki-Rayan.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6943"/><figcaption><em>Cosmic Development's CEO, Ryan Milnes (left) and Vladimir Novachki, CTO of Cosmic Development (right)</em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The story of Vladimir Novachki begins with his internship at Cosmic. For Vladimir, this wasn’t just an ordinary internship experience. He was excited that as an intern he had the opportunity to work on real applications, used by real people. After completing his internship, he was more than willing to take the job offer. Novachki had a chance to lead tech teams and work on various projects before landing the Chief Technology Officer position. For young developers, Novachki has simple advice: “Magic wands don’t exist in real life, when it comes to programming it’s really important to stay up-to-date with the newest technology. Make sure to fully dedicate yourself to continuous learning in this profession and the success is yours!” Novachki has practical ways of getting the right sources of information regarding the latest technology trends. He uses Practical Dev, Hacker News, Reddit, etc. His favorite technology stack is LEMP and he highly recommends it.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is the sixth year of Viktorija working at Cosmic. She started her career as an intern, had successful cooperation with her mentors there, and was more than willing to continue her journey with Cosmic. As a developer, she faced a lot of obstacles but managed to overcome them. Her main challenges were associated with the lack of a standardized development process. Velichkovska started to notice this phenomenon while working on projects with different teams. “Every individual has a specific work approach, which is great but has an impact on the complexity of the work, therefore it’s more time-consuming.” Instead of being discouraged, Velichkovska became more proactive. For the less experienced developers, she recommends building experience through open-source projects. </p>

<h2>Over a Decade-Long Careers at Cosmic Development  </h2>

<h3>Atanas Arizanov - Tech Coordiantor </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6946,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Arizanov.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6946"/><figcaption><em>Atanas Arizanov (left) receiving his loyalty award from Ryan Milnes</em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Atanas Arizanov joined Cosmic eleven years ago. He remembers his humble beginnings as a software engineer, PHP developer, and later on tech coordinator. From the very beginning, Arizanov was well aware of the challenges that are an integral part of this industry. As a tech coordinator, Arizanov has many responsibilities including managing multiple projects, regular and consistent communication with internal teams, while simultaneously controlling the system and network performance. This job position is quite demanding, as Arizanov states “It’s a race with time.” Nevertheless, Arizanov knows that having an internal feeling of peace is the key to overcoming any job deadline. With a smile on his face, while drinking his favorite cup of coffee Arizanov shares some very interesting pieces of advice. “Make sure to organize your day in such a productive manner, that you’ll become faster and more efficient even when your projects and virtual meeting are overlapping.”</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emilija Nikoloska started to work for Cosmic back in 2011. At that period, the company had just started with only six employees. She worked with only one client, just like everyone else. Due to her hard work and determination, she became a Team Lead and then an Office Manager. She was quite successful in that field but strived for more. Later on, her proactive attitude and diligence brought her into the Business Consultant role. It proved to be the right fit for both parties. Nikoloska shares that she finds inspiration and limitless energy from motherhood. </p>

<h1>Bookmark's Success Stories </h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="http://www.bookmark.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bookmark </a>is one of the loyal clients that Cosmic has had since the very beginning. Here are some interesting stories from some of the best employees there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Atanas Krangov [CTO] and Petar Shokarovski [VP of Engineering]</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":6940,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Shokre-Krangov.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6940"/><figcaption><em>Atanas Krangov, CTO of Bookmark.com (left) and Petar Shokarovski VP of Engineering at Bookmark.com (right)</em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Atanas Krangov started as a PHP developer for Cosmic ten years ago. Since then, he made a drastic step in his career and progressed to a Chief Technology Officer for Bookmark. Krangov says that it’s not a role without challenges but he most certainly likes to overcome them. He found his passion for programming at a very young age. He soon realized that he is good at solving problems, and when it comes to software development simplifying the problem means everything. Apart from his professional life, Krangov likes to spend his free time motorcycling and having some leisure time with his family.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Petar Shokarovski became part of the Cosmic family more than seven years ago. He started as a web developer with a previous experience of almost 12 years. This is the reason why he is regarded as one of the MVPs in the company. His professional experience gave him the opportunity to progress as a VP of Engineering for Bookmark. A job title that he holds so proudly. Shokarovski is a dynamic person he has a food blog, likes to spend some time in the wild, and enjoys biking.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">VSCode, a Microsoft product, is one of the most popular web application development tools among full-stack developers. It is a fast and lightweight code editor used for writing modern web and cloud applications and is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS. The best thing about Visual Studio Code is that it is free and open-source and that it encompasses tons of features like code refactoring and syntax highlighting, along with many more. It is easy to use and beginner-friendly. It is also customizable, including many extensions that range from debugging, connecting, or deploying into the cloud. Plus, it integrates with GitHub and can be utilized with various languages and frameworks, such as Ruby, JavaScript, Typescript. Rust, Node.js, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/"><strong>Chrome Developer Tools</strong></a><strong> - debugging tool for web developers.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Browser developer tools are built into most modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari and are a preferred tool of most developers. Google Chrome Developer Tools or Chrome DevTools are debugging tools built into the Chrome browser designed to help you in front-end development. These are some of the most useful tools that allow web developers to edit their code in real-time, diagnose issues, and debug their code quicker, thus building better websites faster.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/shutterstock_1143603746.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7020"/><figcaption> Source: Shutterstock </figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another excellent tool for full-stack developers is Docker. It is an open-source software platform used for creating, deploying, and running applications in a lightweight virtual environment called a container. Packing up application code and all the dependencies used in the application into a single package improves application performance and allows it to run efficiently in different environments. It also makes your applications more portable and scalable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And why every software developer should learn Docker in 2022?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Docker is a technology that transformed the tech industry in the past years by making containerization the new norm. As organizations are moving toward the Cloud environment, the use of containers is growing rapidly and is now part of the standard architecture for businesses with a cloud-first approach. According to Gartner,&nbsp;<a href="https://businessresources.bitdefender.com/gartner-2021-market-guide-for-cloud-workload-protection-platforms?hs_preview=CPRimYYO-51790146713&amp;hsLang=en-us">85% of organizations</a>&nbsp;will be using containers by 2025 (up from less than 30% in 2020.) Undoubtedly, the container model will be critical in the coming years, meaning tools like Docker are a must for modern-day developers.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">GitHub is the world's largest online software development platform used by software developers to store, track, manage and control changes to their code. As of November 2021, it has over 73 million developers and more than 200 million repositories, making it the most extensive web-based hosting service for IT projects.

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">All notable companies have one thing in common - strong company culture. Company culture reflects a company's core values, goals, behaviors, and habits. It is a foundation of every organization and a crucial part of running a successful business, as it directly affects performance, employee retention, innovation, and customer service. However, building a winning company culture doesn't happen by accident or overnight. It takes hard work and perseverance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although each company has unique qualities and its elements vary across companies, all thriving companies have certain key qualities in common. Therefore, this article will break down five essential elements of strong organizational culture. It will also take Cosmic Development as an example of a company that successfully established and fostered unique corporate culture and created a place where great people can do great work. Read on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Recognition</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Making recognition and appreciation part of your company culture will serve as a powerful motivational tool and foster a happy, engaged, and productive environment. When employees are supported and heard by the organization, they will always do more than expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7049,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CCBlognick-1024x724.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7049"/><figcaption>Cosmic Development's CEO Ryan Milnes (right) handing out an anniversary award to our colleague Nick</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Employee recognition can take many forms; formal or informal, verbal, written, or monetary. Also, it can come from various sources like a company-to-employee, manager-to-employee, or peer-to-peer. Effective recognition strategy should be consistent, fair, specific, and personal, not just some short-term tactic to boost morale. It should be part of employees' everyday job experience, whether they are working in the office or remotely.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At Cosmic Development, employee recognition has always been a crucial aspect of its strategy and values. We reward our employees for effort, behavior, or results that align with company values or goals. As a company, we constantly remind them how their contributions have benefited the organization. From a job well done regularly to yearly formal evaluations, we never forget to recognize and reward our employees for achieving milestones, anniversaries, and contributions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Common employee recognitions include certificates for various contributions like lectures, training, and participation in external events and activities. Plus, financial rewards like raises, bonuses, vouchers, or gift cards.&nbsp;In addition to that, we recognize loyalty and long-term service with loyalty awards for those who stayed with us for a considerable time. Therefore, we are proud to say that we have many employees with over five, seven, and ten years working at the company, which is a proof that we are a company with strong values.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Employee-Centered Workplace</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Companies with an employee-centric environment prioritize employee engagement, autonomy, and creativity. Employees appreciate their work and are key players in the company's growth and success. They feel valued and encouraged to make suggestions and are given the possibility to develop their skills and talents by working in a collaborative culture. The employee-centered workplace is a space that promotes free-flowing communication and employee <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/giving-developers-feedback-the-right-way/">feedback</a>. It is also a place that emphasizes employees' well-being and offers benefits that help them maintain a healthy work-life balance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7052,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CCBlogpicnic-1024x724.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7052"/><figcaption>Our team from Bitola hanging out on Earth Day 2022 and making a positive environmental impact </figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In our ten years of experience fostering positive organizational culture, growing from only a few people to more than 200 we have today, we at Cosmic Development succeeded in creating a collaborative, flexible, and people-first culture. We were among the first companies in Macedonia that offered the benefit of flexible working hours and remote work. Instead of micromanaging, we trust our people and give them the freedom to approach their workday as it suits them best. We also prioritize employee well-being and have many fantastic benefits tailored to the employees' needs and preferences, including health and wellness programs, all to keep our people happy and provide them with great employee experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Core Values</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Core values support your company's vision and mission and shape its culture. They should be consistently integrated into everything you do and clearly and transparently communicated to all the employees, clients, and stakeholders. That allows your company to perform at a high level and ensures that employees work towards the same goals. Some examples of core values are</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Teamwork</li><li>Loyalty</li><li>Autonomy</li><li>Honesty</li><li>Integrity</li><li>Accountability</li><li>Task Ownership</li><li>Constant Improvement</li><li>Work ethic</li><li>Work-life balance</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development has been built on core values and principles. We have successfully created a strong culture around the principles of integrity, social responsibility, passion, curiosity, ownership, and proactivity. They reflect our commitment to impact our employees, clients, and communities positively. From taking part in local trash cleanup and picnic to mark Earth Day to participating in the "<a href="https://donirajkompjuter.mk/">Donate a computer"</a>&nbsp;initiative (the most recent) we live, breathe, and work in alignment with our values every day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Flexible Schedules</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The future of work is all about flexibility and choice, and if companies want to stay ahead of the competition, they should introduce flexible working arrangements. A flexible work schedule is an excellent way of helping your employees achieve a better work-life balance and, as a result, increased productivity at work. It is beneficial to both the organization and the employees and goes much beyond increasing productivity and efficiency. It also:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Improves Retention&nbsp;</li><li>Attracts Top Talent</li><li>Improves Employee Engagement&nbsp;</li><li>It's Cost-Efficient and Eco-Friendly</li><li>Improves well-being&nbsp;</li><li>Increase job satisfaction&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Flexible working hours allow people a level of autonomy to arrange their workday around their lives and not vice-versa. What's important is results and completed tasks, not the time spent at work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7051,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CCBlog3-1-1024x724.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7051"/><figcaption>Marija, Jove, and Teofil planning their mutual tasks and implementing them in their weekly schedule</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic has embraced flexible work culture long before the pandemic. We trust our employees to work flexible hours and from remote places. Our goal has always been to ensure that our people are satisfied and supported no matter where and when they choose to work in the most convenient way to them. As long as you are productive and deliver high-quality work, you can set your own schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Supportive Leadership</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Leaders play a huge role in shaping an organization's culture because culture comes from the top. Modern-day leaders are supportive. They mentor and coach rather than micromanage and treat their employees with dignity and respect. Leaders also build a sense of community and foster a culture of collaboration and communication. They act as examples in all company areas and accept recommendations for changes. Supportive leaders work hand-in-hand with their employees and show genuine interest in those they work with. They advocate for their people, provide opportunities, and share success.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7053,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Certificate-Sanja-1024x724.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7053"/><figcaption>Petar, VP of Engineering for Bookmark.com, working hand by hand with his teammates Marko and ilan</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Supportive leadership is an effective leadership style and one of the traits of modern workplaces, one of which is Cosmic Development. Our leaders treat employees as equals and do everything to remove barriers and help them thrive. They bring out the best in people through coaching, mentoring, and listening, qualities that prove to be vital during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Strong company culture stands out as one of the crucial pieces vital to sustaining performance and competitive advantage. Not only that, but it also brings employees together and helps to propel everyone forward so that the company reaches its goals. Cosmic Development is a company whose culture operates off these five core elements. Our culture projects a strong and clear vision and gives our employees a sense of purpose in their work. Check out our most recent <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/careers/">job openings</a> if you want to be a part of our unique and people-centric company culture.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Human Resources department plays a pivotal role in a company's overall growth strategy and is an integral part of any modern-day organization. In the last years, the responsibilities of the HR department and HR managers have grown considerably, and now a professional HR department encompasses many roles and activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being an HR professional requires commitment and dedication. After all, they are responsible for managing a company's human capital, its most important asset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Besides managing the employee life cycle like recruitment, hiring, onboarding, training and firing, employee relations, and benefits management, they are also responsible for protecting the employee's well-being and keeping them satisfied. They also play a crucial role in shaping and reinforcing the company's culture and creating a positive working environment while focusing on company values.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Given that many activities in the workplace are impacted by HR, a strong human resources department is the best way to ensure employee satisfaction, productivity, and future growth, thus setting the foundation for a thriving company.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The HR strategy at Cosmic Development is simple – be a high-performing company and a great place to work. Our HR team is our partner in business. They are the company's driving force because they manage the most critical and valuable resource we have - our people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic HR managers and other related professionals work hard together to support the needs of our employees at various stages of their careers. HR ensures that they have the right tools and resources to perform to thrive and maximize their input.&nbsp;&nbsp;They focus on employee well–being and offer professional support in addition to compensation, benefits, career advancement, and work-life balance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">HR has always been important, but the past two years have demonstrated why it is instrumental in keeping businesses afloat. We successfully <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/the-role-of-an-hr-manager-in-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">navigated the challenges</a> in recruiting, retention, and safety and managed to assist our employees during the pandemic's stressful circumstances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The best way to acknowledge employees' roles, efforts, and achievements is to celebrate them throughout the year. Today, to mark the International HR Day and recognize the hardworking and dedicated HR professionals, we will offer you a glimpse of the individuals who work hard to help Cosmic Development constantly improve, accelerate, and grow.

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Who is Marina</strong>?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Marina is a graduate economist in the accounting, finance, and audit section, but as a person who loves to work with people, her career path took her to human resources. She spends her time with her loved ones and friends, reading books, and cycling.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><em><strong>When you joined Cosmic Development, you had the chance to become part of a rapidly growing team with a lot going on. How was that experience? What do you love most about your job, especially here?&nbsp;</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Joining a rapidly growing company was challenging to do on the one hand. Still, it was like an adventure to discover and learn new things, get more professional in my experience, and meet new people. The work is very dynamic but having flexible working hours and working remotely when needed gives me the freedom to manage the tasks properly. The <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/cosmic-development-and-24hr-mk-talk-about-the-flexibility-at-work/">flexibility</a> and the right HR team besides me are the things that I love most about my job.</p>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Who is Liljana?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Liljana is an IT recruiter at Cosmic Development. She has a Master's degree in Human Resources Management and enjoys working and communicating with people. She loves encouraging employees and strives to create a happy workplace. When Liljana is not busy recruiting new talent, she enjoys spending time with her sons Matej and Luka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><em><strong>Your expertise is recruitment. But what does it mean to be a tech recruiter? What traits do you need to be successful in your field?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Yes, my specialty in Cosmic is recruitment. To be a recruiter, you have to be many things. You need to be curious by nature and ask the right questions. You need to have excellent research skills and be up to date with the latest trends. You also need strong negotiation skills and be able to communicate with potential candidates effectively. People skills and knowing how to listen are essential for building relationships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another important thing is to be a good storyteller and tell stories that answer questions and provide the information the candidates need to decide if the company is a good fit as an employer. Storytelling is the best way to connect potential candidates with your brand and work culture and communicate what a company offers. The same skills that apply to sales marketing, like communication, strong organization and negotiation skills, and patience, apply to recruitment. You need skills to "sell" the job to the candidate and "sell" the candidate to the client.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Who is Andriana?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Andriana has almost five years of experience in the human resources field and has been Cosmic Development's HR manager for the past nine months. She has a Master's degree in Business Informatics and Management from the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia and started working for Cosmic just a few days after finishing her studies. Initially, she began as an office manager, moving to the HR assistant position, and finally, the most recent, HR manager.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Besides her professional responsibilities and obligations, Andriana always tries to fit physical activities into her busy schedule and spends at least an hour daily doing exercise or in nature. She enjoys traveling and visiting new places. She is also an animal lover and a devoted owner of two dogs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><em><strong>What are the future company plans and goals?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At this moment, the company is growing rapidly, and we constantly have new positions open. In the first quarter of 2022 alone, we've had 16 new colleagues. In fact, hardly a day goes by without communicating or interviewing potential candidates, whether for IT or non-technical job positions. That is clear evidence of the company's growth and makes me incredibly happy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the future, we will continue working in the same spirit. We already have plans to continue growing our team. We also plan to make internal organizational changes and introduce new benefits. And our priority will remain the retention and encouragement of our employees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><em><strong>As the main HR Manager, what's the secret formula to making all things happen?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">HR encompasses many things—from effective communication, patience, ability to analyze and see things from different angles to planning and multitasking. What's most important for me and most challenging at the same time is establishing a healthy relationship and collaboration with the employees – which is the essence of being an HR professional. In terms of the secret formula, I would say that besides loving what you do, you'll also need ideas and a strong will to make things happen. With thorough planning ahead, you can achieve anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A company is only as good as its people and the HR team is in charge of creating and maintaining a solid team. Strong HR departments help companies get the most from their people and help people get the most of the companies. They serve as the advocates for employees and help companies recruit and retain top talent to help a business succeed. That is why investing in Human Resources should be a priority of every company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development succeeded in building a strong and effective HR department. Our employees can use HR to voice concerns and experiences. At Cosmic, we believe that only by working hand in hand can managers and employees build an environment that inspires and engages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you want to work in a thriving company that is focused on improving employee experience at each stage in the employee lifecycle and a company that offers numerous benefits and a flexible work schedule, we encourage you to check our <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/careers/">open positions</a>.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h3><strong>Have a Clear Definition of Done</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">DoD (definition of done) is a set of criteria that need to be met for an aspect of the project or a task to be considered complete. Both in terms of quality and functionality. Explicit completion criteria should be defined from the start, and it should be a collaborative effort between the development team and the stakeholders. In that way, the whole team will be aligned and follow the same objectives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In essence, the definition of done is a checklist of all the work that team needs to do before indicating the product increment as “done” or releasable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">How will you measure it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Groom Your Backlog</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cleaning your backlog is vital for keeping the project organized. Your backlog will keep growing if you are not actively shaping it. A large backlog will lead to frustration and slow the whole process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">What can you do?</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Collaborate with Team Members</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Effective team collaboration is essential for successful software development projects. Whether you are working on a software project by yourself or as part of a team, working together towards a common goal and sharing high-level skills will ensure that the whole process goes smoothly, from inception to delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We witness an age of amazing technological breakthroughs, increasing demand for new software, and higher customer expectations, so having a QA engineer in a software development team is becoming increasingly necessary for successful software businesses. It saves time, money, nerves, and a company's reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Quality assurance (QA) engineers monitor every stage of the development process of a product. They oversee production, design and implement tests, debug and recommend improvements, making sure that the product operates on the highest quality level before it is released to the public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although some software companies take QA lightly and don't have QA engineers in their development team, Cosmic Development is quite the opposite. We recognize the true value of quality assurance and believe that building high-quality, stable, and safe products for our clients requires a competent QA engineer.&nbsp;For that reason, today, we spotlight our talented Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer, Kosta Terziski, and discuss the details of his journey, day-to-day tasks, and advice he would offer to aspiring QA professionals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

" class="wp-image-7110" width="841" height="655"/><figcaption>Kosta Terziski</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Who is Kosta?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Kosta is QA Automation Engineer. He joined Cosmic Development in 2014, and since then, he has quickly become an integral part of our development team. He plays a crucial role in Cosmic's software development process, delivering high value to our company and clients. Apart from having enviable skills for tracking down the bugs that undermine a product's performance and an excellent eye for detail, he is a proud father of a 4-month baby boy, Filip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How did you join Cosmic Development, and what’s your overall experience in a few words?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I joined <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cosmic-development/mycompany/verification/?viewAsMember=true">Cosmic </a>on an Internship program back in October 2014. I have been in the company ever since. It's a fantastic experience, to say the least, considering that I have worked on many great projects with a great group of people.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Why did you opt for a career as a QA engineer?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are numerous reasons why I opted for a career as a QA engineer. It’s challenging, valuable, creative, you are constantly learning, and most importantly, it's in demand. Testing is not easy, and it requires excellent problem-solving skills. But I enjoy solving complex problems, looking at products from different angles, and giving developers a new perspective on their work. Each day is a new challenge and brings something new.&nbsp;This is not a job for those who prefer boring and simple jobs and should think twice before choosing a career path in software testing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Can you describe your role as a QA Engineer at Cosmic Development? What does a 'typical' day look like? </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Coffee first. Always. And at least 15 minutes to go with that coffee of reading emails and Slack messages just to catch up on what is expected of you in the day ahead.&nbsp;Next in line are daily meetings, which usually don't last longer than 15 to 20 minutes.&nbsp;And after that - work!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What skills did you bring to the team, and what skills have you developed since joining?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Back when I joined Cosmic, I can hardly say that I brought a lot of skills, but I can certainly say that I was a good listener. This was an opportunity for me to learn from a great group of mentors, most of whom I am still working with. Throughout the years, I have worked on many challenging projects that made me who I am today.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Can you explain the difference between manual testing vs. automation testing? Can automation testing replace manual testing?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Automation testing will not replace manual testing. It would be best if you had both manual and automation testing skills. Manual testing handles complex test cases, while automated testing handles simpler, more repetitive tests. So, manual testing is still important. But adding automated testing makes your manual tests more efficient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How do you keep up with the latest trends and technologies?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keeping up with the latest trends and technologies is important in this business line. There are numerous ways I do that: join tech forums, do my own research on the internet, and attend seminars. Plus, Cosmic provides us with access to many online learning tools and resources, and we always have the opportunity to take a course online or with a physical presence, if possible.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What advice would you give to young people keen to pursue a career as a QA engineers?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A job in QA is rewarding and impactful. Take pride in your work and the people you work for because you are essentially changing the world for the better and making sure we live in a bug-free world. It doesn’t matter what product you’re working on. By finding and preventing errors, you are making people’s lives better, and you could even save lives. Be flexible, adaptable, and disciplined. Have patience and trust yourself. Think outside the box and pay attention to details. Be a good team player, and most importantly, never stop learning and improving.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">You've probably heard about the newest trend among remote employees and companies - workation. For those unfamiliar with the term, workation (work + vacation) describes the practice of combining working remotely and vacation. This is not a completely new notion. However, it became increasingly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic when remote work became 'a new normal'. The pandemic changed how we work for the better, and now it's changing how we vacation. Now, with the advancement in remote work tools and technologies, it is easier for employees to work on projects from remote locations while enjoying a break from the regular daily routine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The possibility of working and vacationing at the same time may sound unbelievable, but we can assure you it's reality. We are one of the few companies that adopted this hybrid work model that allowed working remotely even before the pandemic. Our people are free to create a work schedule that suits them best. They are able work from wherever they want, as long as that doesn't interfere with their tasks and duties. The well-being of our people is vital to <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/strong-company-culture-5-key-elements/">our company culture</a>. For that reason, along with the flexible work schedules and relaxed working atmosphere, we introduced remote work options long before it became a trend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this article, we'll share with you how our Cosmic citizens enjoyed their summer while working from various locations and why embracing a remote work policy and flexible working hours is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>The Benefits of Summer Workations&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Why work from one place when you can take your work anywhere? Why not?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7139,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7139"/><figcaption>Our colleague Ivan from the office in Belgrade working remote </figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Workations come with huge benefits that are difficult to ignore. When you are not tied to your working desks all day and don't waste time commuting, you have more freedom and flexibility to explore other options while performing your professional responsibilities and earning money. And, if you are working from home most of the time, you know that it can become quite tedious and leave you feeling stuck after a while.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Workations are an excellent opportunity to enjoy a much-needed change in scenery while you work. And you can use your spare time to relax and explore new places,. This is a great motivator and it promotes well-being. It can also enhance your productivity and creativity, give you a different perspective and encourage new ideas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Waking up by the sea or in the mountains, drinking your coffee with a panoramic view of nature, and working online with your work desk pointing towards your favorite mountains or beaches, is definitely far better than spending eight hours in the office staring at a blank wall or working in a busy, stressful environment. However, workations shouldn't be regarded as a substitute for actual holidays because you still need time to shut off from work completely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How Cosmic Citizens Enjoyed Remote Work Perks This Summer</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Cosmic team took full advantage of their freedom and flexibility this summer and combined work and lovely summer sceneries. Besides working from the comfort of their gardens and balconies, our employees enjoyed the benefit of working from their hometowns and different distant getaway locations in nature while still getting the work done.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here's how some of our employees spend the summer and the beautiful sights they visit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7138,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Certificate-Sanja-1024x724.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7138"/><figcaption>The Cosmic team working from various remote places</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Are Summer Workations Good for Companies?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Yes! It's not only the employees that reap the benefits from the workations; it's the company too. Business success, job performance, and employee well-being are closely connected.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When companies invest in their people's mental and physical well-being and trust them to work from anywhere, they have happier employees. And happy employees work harder and better than those who aren't.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The benefits of flexible work schedules and workations include better productivity and creativity. It also boosts employee satisfaction, motivation, and morale. Moreover, it is a great way to build employee loyalty and retention because the new generation of workers puts great value on flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, companies should establish a clear remote work policy and outline expectations that everyone in the company can rely on. With a solid work-from-home policy, teams are more likely to achieve their goals, keep productivity, and be satisfied with their work. This includes performance expectations, availability expectations, working hours, expected response time for each communication channel, client confidentiality, cybersecurity, and equipment requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In our company, summer benefits are a way to reward hard work and give people a break they need. But, remote work and summer workations come with a responsibility to deliver high-quality work to benefit our clients. Our employees have the flexibility to work from home. However, we still sometimes require that they are available during certain core hours that overlap with their team members. That way, we ensure that everyone is available for team meetings or clients in certain time zones.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Join Cosmic Development and enjoy the freedom of choosing your workspace.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Freedom and flexibility are perks at the core of our company culture, and we are really proud of having them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->

However, we are still keeping our offices open for those that want to work from an office setting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Get to know our Web Designer Marko Pavlovich in the latest Cosmic Development Employee Spotlight.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Undoubtedly a well-designed website is a powerful digital marketing tool that can help businesses increase their online presence and credibility and make them stand out among competitors. An exceptional website not only looks good, but it is easy to navigate, user-friendly, and provides the visitors with the best user experience with the brand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Successful companies know how to identify and meet users' expectations and do that by hiring competent professionals with the necessary skills to achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Web developers and web designers, be it UX (user experience or UI (user interface), are the bridge between a brand vision and the website. They study the company's goals and design and create unique and well-functioning websites. One such professional at Cosmic Development is Marko Pavlovich.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Who is Marko?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Marko is a web designer with&nbsp; 15 years of experience in the IT industry. Marko is enthusiastic and passionate about designing websites and apps and has successfully delivered unique design solutions for many of our clients since he joined Cosmic in 2017. He specializes in User Experience (UX) Design and focuses on building effective and easy-to-use websites. He is responsible for understanding the users and investigates and understands their habits, needs, behaviors, motivations, and emotions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here's some more information about Marko we learned during our recent chat:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>It is your fifth year at Cosmic Development. Any aspects of the company culture and the working environment would you like to point out?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For the last five years, my main focus has been UX design on exciting projects in finance, games, etc. During that time, I had the opportunity to work on new technologies and improve my knowledge. Much of my success is thanks to Cosmic and the excellent working environment that offers countless learning opportunities. The culture of our team is built upon a shared understanding, trust, and respect.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What makes a good design?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Everything around us is designed, from the services we are used to to the houses we live in, and everything is designed to solve a problem. A good design uses the information available to simplify the users' lives.&nbsp; It shines in both form and function and has a clear purpose. It is visually pleasing and easy to navigate, and technically stable and secure and the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7149,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-design-724x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7149"/><figcaption>Marko Pavlovich</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What's your working style? Any preferences you have in your design style?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My working style is a mix of independence and collaboration with the other team members. When I start a new project, I first get well informed about the product, customers, and the possible solutions that the competition has. In the initial stages, I prefer to work independently. Then I consult with my team to ensure we're all on the same track. We must work together and learn from each other's perspectives if we want to build a great product. In terms of preferences, I always try to keep the audience in mind and provide the best user experience possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How do you communicate your designs with web developers?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As I mentioned, great websites require a joint effort between designers and other team members, especially web developers.&nbsp;Communication is the key here. In my 15 years of experience, I've learned how to clearly and effectively communicate my designs through words or collaboration software. I also do regular check-ins and design reviews to ensure everything is going according to plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Where do you go for inspiration?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Each of us should find inspiration within ourselves and answer the question of what pushes us to the limits and beyond them. For me, hanging out with friends can be a fantastic way to expand my design horizons. People, places, music, films, nature; there are no limits. I can find inspiration anywhere. In addition, I follow several blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels, and Instagram pages. Some of my recommendations are <a href="http://ukplanet.org/">ukplanet.org</a>, <a href="http://smashingmagazine.com/">smashingmagazine.com</a>, <a href="http://usabilitigeek.com/">usabilitigeek.com</a>, The Futur, AJ&amp;Smart, Flux, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-design.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7150" width="840" height="704"/><figcaption>Marko and his colleagues from our office in Belgrade, working remotely</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What do you believe is the most exciting new big thing in UX design?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One thing that excites me most about working in web design, especially in UX, is that our industry is constantly changing and evolving. Many new technologies are emerging every day, and it is crucial to stay up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">&nbsp;Surely, the Metaverse will drive UX design, and UX designers should prepare for this new era. Designs led by virtual and augmented reality, and AI, are definitely the future of UX.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What tools or programs do you use for design?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I prefer to use Adobe applications, such as XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, but I am familiar with other tools created for UX/UI designers. Figma is one of them that I like to use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What advice would you give to younger colleagues?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My advice to younger designers is not to be afraid and not to stop believing in themselves and their talents because of others' criticism of their work. This is a long race. Start with jogging until you run a marathon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before we move on to the list of the best tutorials, let's first clarify why you should learn PHP in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Why Learn PHP?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Even though its popularity has declined over the years, PHP is still extensively used in web development. Efficient, flexible, simple, and easy to learn, you can create anything from a simple website to a complex web application with PHP. It's free and open-source, supports most web browsers, and has many additional tools to assist it. Additionally, it has a large and active community of developers to learn and get help for your web development projects.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And since there are still millions of sites built using PHP, PHP developers are always in demand, and there are many job opportunities available, both in freelancing and full-time jobs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<ol class="has-medium-font-size"><li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Learn PHP by Codecademy</strong></a></li></ol>

<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-default"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Content Managers are an embodiment of a company's content marketing and ensure business success in the digital world. They understand the voice of the brand they represent and use it to communicate with customers. At Cosmic Development, Ivana Radulovic is that person. She has been part of the </em><a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/celebration-of-success-ten-years-of-outsourcing-tech-talent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cosmic family</em></a><em> since 2015, working as a Content Manager for one of our fastest-growing clients</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How did it all start?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Through the years, I've changed roles and been part of several Cosmic Development teams. In the beginning, I was in the Business Development team and had the role of a Publisher Account Strategist. My main job was finding big and attractive publishers that would be posting our content on their sites. That brings value not only to the content creators but also to the publishers. As the platform grew over the past years and management started doing some internal transformations, I got the chance to work in different sectors, which helped me understand how the platform works.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working in different sectors through the years brought me to the content manager position. My primary responsibilities include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li>Getting on track with the latest trending content.</li><li>Finding content that has the potential to become viral.</li><li>Getting in touch with huge Content Creators.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Attracting huge content creators to work with us and getting in touch with public figures and famous media and TV companies from around the world is the most exciting part of my job. It's like a dream come true!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Can you tell us the pros and cons of being a Content Manager?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7178,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-3-1-1024x577.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7178"/><figcaption>Ivana Radulovic (right) working with her team</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In short, it's both exciting and demanding! The long answer is - the pros are being exposed to more growth opportunities and responsibilities, whereas the cons are the deadlines and making sure you reach the right decisions. In other words, knowing that you are trusted to make crucial decisions is always a great feeling. Being in charge of a team means being in charge of employee schedules, ordering supplies, tracking performance, budgeting, etc. Managers have a great deal of responsibility, which can be an exciting benefit and opportunity for the right person.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In terms of experience, landing a managerial position means turning your job into a career. And when you love what you do, and you love your team and colleagues, it's truly a blessing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">But, part of being a manager is making some tough decisions. Keeping the balance between the upper management decisions and the needs and preferences of the employees is really challenging. Reaching a compromise, especially in situations where all sides shall be happy and the end goal is reached, is stressful. Another downside is the constant chase with time to complete everything on time and yet stay ahead of the latest trends and happenings.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How do you keep up with the latest trends in your industry?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The essence of my job as a Content Manager is researching and identifying emerging trends, so it is only natural that we quickly come into contact with the latest trends in our industry. The advancements in technology and the availability of accessible and high-quality information helps us to keep up with the competition. This industry is based on competitive analysis, which enables us to determine what's new on the market.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Your passion doesn't stop at doing your job as a Content Manager solely. You are also a Brand Ambassador who actively participates in company events and activities. Tell us more about this, and please share what drives you.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My passion for the job, the company, and the people I work with play a big role. They support me at the right times, unselfishly and consistently, which is a true driving force for me to represent the company in the best way possible. The energy is mutual and circular. What you give is what you get. A successful company is a result of happy, loyal and truthful employees.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>If you are looking for some work-from-home productivity tips, you are at the right place. At Cosmic Development, we have practiced remote work in various formats for years and our employees are sharing their experiences and tips on staying productive.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7210,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/We-are-hiring-4-1024x536.jpg" alt="We asked some of our coworkers that have experience in working remotely to share tips on how they maintain their productivity." class="wp-image-7210"/><figcaption>Home Office Setup</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the past two and a half years, the way we work and live has dramatically transformed. The pandemic has normalized remote and flexible work. Cloud technology and advanced communication and collaboration tools have allowed companies to embrace remote work and reap the benefits it can bring. Instead of being a temporary pandemic measure, work from home has become a lasting feature of the modern workplace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Despite the apparent benefits of remote work, like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/cosmic-development-and-24hr-mk-talk-about-the-flexibility-at-work/" rel="noreferrer noopener">freedom and flexibility</a>, no commute, a higher quality of life, and better work-life balance, working remotely is more complex than it seems and can bring many unexpected challenges. This perk can turn into a missed opportunity if not handled carefully, and you can become your own worst enemy,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Productivity is one of the biggest challenges, especially if you are new to remote work. Having that in mind, we’ve compiled a list of some essential remote working productivity tips from our employees. We also asked a few to share their personal experience in working remotely and explain how they navigate the pitfalls and ensure they stay focused, productive, and happy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7209,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Define-boundaries-1-1-1024x329.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7209"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Set up a home office space that limits distraction</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Whether a corner in your living room or a separate room turned into an office, it is crucial to designate an official home workspace where you can comfortably work without noise and distractions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Create a healthy, stimulating environment that best suits your personal ergonomic and productivity needs. Keep it clutter-free and organized. Add houseplants to boost your mood, and if possible, put your desk by the window to have access to natural light because it will improve your mental alertness and focus. Invest in equipment that will enhance your performance - adjustable desks, ergonomic desk chairs, spacious monitors or laptop stands, and noise-cancelling headphones. A dedicated workspace will give a sense of legitimacy to your work environment and help you maintain boundaries between home and work life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7208,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Define-boundaries-1024x329.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7208"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Define boundaries</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Besides having a separate workspace where you can concentrate and minimize disruptions, it is equally important to put clear boundaries between work time and family. It can be hard to separate your work from your personal life, especially if you have children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, everything is possible with a little more pre-planning and communication.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Work out a schedule with your household members and inform them of your working schedule and that you are unavailable during this time. Ensure that your home office is off-limits when working and that your work does not intrude into other people's lives. Learn to say no, because you can easily become stressed and overwhelmed by others' demands, which will definitely affect your productivity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The opposite is also true, setting healthy work boundaries to avoid overworking. Stick to your work schedule, do your work as best as possible, and once your work day is over, switch off, put away your work tools and enjoy your free time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And remember - setting your boundaries is in your own hands. If you don't respect them, no one else will either. It is a battle you'll need to fight for yourself, but with time you'll become a master of juggling work and family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7206,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Define-boundaries-2-1024x329.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7206"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Set up a work schedule and maintain a daily routine</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The best thing when working from home is the flexibility to establish a routine that's ideal for you. Creating and following a work schedule will save your sanity and boost your productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here are some steps you can follow:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li><strong>Maintain consistent working hours.</strong>&nbsp;Decide the time when you will start and finish working each day and commit to it. Plan for virtual meetings with others in your schedule, childcare, or any other responsibilities you may have throughout the day. Be aware that you'll need to be flexible from time to time and that there will be exceptions to your rules. Sometimes you'll have to give extra time to your work and sometimes to your personal life.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li><strong>Discover your most productive time of the day.&nbsp;</strong>Some people peak in the morning, others in the afternoon or night. By aligning your schedule with your peak energy times, you make it easier to focus on work when you feel the most energized and motivated, thus being more productive, focused, and quicker.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li><strong>Track your time</strong>. Time tracking can help you be more aware of how you spend your time during the day and how much time you spend on each assigned task. This practice will give you valuable insights into your productivity and help you find ways to improve and optimize your workflow. If you're unsure how to do that,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.forestapp.cc/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forest</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/rescuetime/" rel="noreferrer noopener">RescueTime</a>, and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://toggl.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toggl&nbsp;</a>are just some of the many time-tracking apps you can use.

<h2><strong>Set priorities</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Taking a proactive approach will give you a sense of accomplishment and put you in control of your day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the biggest productivity mistakes you can make is focusing on getting as many tasks as possible instead of doing the most important ones. So start by identifying your main to-do's for the day, and qualify them by their urgency. Try the Rule of Three - a simple but effective productivity hack that requires you to focus on accomplishing only three essential goals every day. You can apply this rule not only for your day but also for your week, month, and year. Our brains are not evolved to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, so by engaging in fewer tasks, you increase your focus and are more efficient. Similar productivity methods you can also try are the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://pomofocus.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pomodoro Technique</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://v.fastcdn.co/u/3a1b1cdf/28214067-0-Zen-To-Done-by-Leo-B.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zen to Done Rule</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Take regular breaks and practice self-care</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working remotely and sitting all day can harm your body and mind. Don't hesitate to take a break and recharge. Regular micro-break breaks throughout your working day will lower the risk of burnout, reduce stress levels, and increase overall productivity. They are good for both your physical and mental well-being. A play with your kids or pet, a short conversation, listening to music, stretching, breathing, whatever you like, as long as it is a break from screen time and gets you moving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Incorporate self-care into your daily routine, whether that is walking in the park, regular exercise, spending time in nature, contacting loved ones, watching a good movie, reading a book, cooking a fun meal, or spending virtual social time with colleagues. These activities will lower your stress, help you relax, and clear your mind.</p>

<h2><strong>Stay engaged in company life</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working from home can get boring and lonely. If you feel isolated, you will not be happy or productive. Fortunately, with the technologies today, you can easily stay engaged with the team and be involved in daily company life. Stay in touch with your colleagues via Slack or similar cloud-based collaboration tools. Try video chats, participate in different events and activities and stay connected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working from home has many&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-remote-working/" rel="noreferrer noopener">great advantages</a>, but when it comes to productivity, it certainly has its drawbacks. It's challenging to maintain an excellent work-life balance and stay productive. But with proper planning and the right tools and techniques, you can create space and time to be effective without letting work interfere with your personal life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Staying productive while working from home is different for everyone. What works for you might not work for somebody else. Find what works best for you, stay productive, and keep your head up no matter what.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">At Cosmic Development, our employees determine our success day in and day out. Our Employee Spotlight series provides a peek behind the scenes of the unique individuals who work hard every day to create the best possible experience for all our clients.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today we chatted with Milan Andreev, a front-end developer. He joined Cosmic Development in 2017 and is currently a front-end developer for our loyal client, <a href="https://www.bookmark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bookmark</a>. Milan is a performance-driven developer who is unafraid to take on challenges and give outputs that impact our company. His positive attitude, collaborative spirit, and love of learning are just a few character traits that make him a beloved member of our engineering team. In addition to his love for technology, he enjoys connecting with nature at any chance he gets, whether by running, rock climbing, mountain biking, or kiteboarding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In today's interview, we discuss his career journey to date, what he does daily as a front-end developer, and what he enjoys doing besides work.</p>

<h2><strong>First, we would like to congratulate you on your 5th anniversary at Cosmic Development. How did it all start?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Thanks. It is my pleasure to work with all of you. It all started five years ago. I worked remotely for more than ten years in many companies before Cosmic. They were small companies with two to five employees. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, with no project management to handle tasks, the workload was hefty, and the pressure was high. And that is why I decided to start fresh in a new big company. When I got the job at Cosmic Development, I felt free, happy, and fulfilled after a long time. I am motivated, the work is always done, and there is always time to catch up with colleagues. I have the best time.</p>

<h2><strong>What does your average workday look like?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a morning person. I get up early, at six or seven, depending on the season. My day starts with a cup of coffee or tea. Then I put on my headphones, play some chillout music, and head for a run or bike ride. Sports activities and watching the sunrise give me a lot of energy for the rest of the day. Then my work day starts. In the morning, I feel the most creative, so I work with clarity at a fast pace. The first thing I do is check the task manager and organize for the day. We often have daily meetings where we share information about progress and future tasks. As the day passes, my concentration drops, which is a lunch alarm. After lunch, another fast pace coding session, a meeting with the colleagues, and the day is over. The best thing about my work is that there is no pressure; everyone is doing their work and helping each other. Cosmic is an environment that is too good to be true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Can you tell us about your background? When did you decide you wanted to build a career in front-end development?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I started working in 1998. My first website was a fun page for the gymnasium Orce Nikolov, the high school where I went. Next, I started working on a project named Autoinfo – an application for listing cars for sale, the first of its kind at that time, and also my first dynamic website built in "ASP." That is how I fell in love with creating websites and applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I graduated in Computer Science and carved out my career in that direction. There were many projects along the way, requiring different skills and engagement, but eventually, I ended up being a front-end developer. There is no particular reason why I chose front-end development; it came naturally. When I worked on full-stack development projects, and we split the work between colleagues, I felt more comfortable working on the front end.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>You mentioned that, at the moment, you are working on design implementation. Can you tell us more about it? For example, what makes a good design implementation, according to you?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For good design implementation, you need a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Use as little code as needed, write clean, high-quality code, and read the designer's intention. They often work in strict dimensions, so you need to code the same design in relative dimensions, so the design is responsive on all devices. And that's it; it is very straightforward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What is the most exciting part about being a front-end developer?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Front-end design is not very exciting, but it is rewarding. The best part is when at the end of the day when I feel fulfilled that I've finished the work as best as I could. The more I accomplish, the better I will feel about myself.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>And finally, who is Milan out of the office? Any outside hobbies or interests?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">An introvert who finds peace and joy in sport and nature. I have a lot of hobbies that are my driving force in life - sports hobbies. I want sports that need a long learning curve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, I started rock climbing many years ago. With rock climbing, you must learn about security, working with the devices for ascending and descending, working on the movement technique, and training endurance and power. The progress is very slow, and that's why I like it. Also, I ride a road and a mountain bike. I want to be closer to nature and enjoy the views from the top of the mountain! I run, too. Although running seems like a basic activity, it isn't. There are also running techniques involved, training for endurance and training for speed, and the progress is also very slow. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I also started kiteboarding, which is the hardest to learn from all of the above. You need to learn about wind windows and direction, controlling the kite, safety, and riding a board - all at the same time. It is very fun and enjoyable. And in wintertime, I ski. In every season, I switch between these sports. Sport makes me an enthusiastic and productive developer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is a great way to unload and restore my body and mind. It gives me the tools and skills to succeed not just in the workplace but in life too.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Pursuing an IT career is quite common nowadays, but carving out a successful IT career journey at the same company for a decade is something you don't see every day. The Managing Director of our company, Antony Naumoff, has built his career at the same IT company and is a rare example of loyalty and dedication. He has been there from the very beginning, throughout the years, up until today, when the company is growing rapidly and has recently celebrated a ten-year jubilee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Read and find out how it all started and the challenges and achievements along the way of the success story that Cosmic Development is today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The original article in Macedonian is available </em><a href="https://inovativnost.mk/2022/11/12/%D1%81%D0%B5-%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B8%D0%BC-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anthony Naumoff is the Managing Director of Cosmic Development. He was born and raised in Chicago, USA, attended Kansas State University, and graduated from University American College Skopje.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7296,"width":841,"height":465,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/entoni-696x385-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7296" width="841" height="465"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">His life story is extraordinary. He is one of the rare people who returned to his parents' homeland and graduated college and started working for a local company. That company started from a small office in Skopje eleven years ago and has spread across four locations with nearly 150 employees today. One of its most loyal clients is a unicorn startup that has recently become a publicly traded company, trading on NASDAQ, and is valued at more than $2 billion. A few people from the Cosmic Development team had the honor of attending the NASDAQ bell-ringing ceremony in New York City, an experience that they will probably never forget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development is a Canadian IT solutions and staff augmentation services provider with over a decade-long tenure. They provide custom-made, dedicated talent solutions to companies of all sizes. Thanks to their unique approach, they select highly-experienced developers and other professionals from different business areas and create flexible and customizable dedicated teams for clients and business partners worldwide. Their outstanding services are supported by a wide net of teams spread across different locations. They have offices in Toronto, Skopje, Bitola, and Belgrade. A company set in this way is a new deal for the IT industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>You are in charge of one of the leading IT consulting and development companies that have put Macedonia on the global map. Tell us how it started eleven years ago and where the company is today.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sure! We started eleven years ago as a company with only one employee, working on a trial period with only one potential client. Luckily, one of Cosmic Development's founders, a very famous and successful businessman from Canada, is of Macedonian origin and his heart and thoughts are always with Macedonia. His respect for the country where his ancestors were born went beyond words, and he tried to help Macedonia in the best possible way. The idea for this success story and opening of this company was born when he visited Macedonia.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After the initial trial period had proven to be more successful than we expected, we started growing slowly but steadily, and we started promoting our business to clients outside of the country and within the country in front of potential employees.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We first opened and started growing the Skopje office. Things went well, resulting in the opening of offices in Belgrade and Bitola. The Belgrade office gave us direct access to a large talent pool from the IT field, which was a clever step in cases when we couldn't find employees with specific skills in Macedonia. At the same time, the office in Bitola helped us grow as a company in providing BPO (business process outsourcing) services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today, with more than 150 employees, it is truly amazing to see the progress we've made. Soon we are opening a modern and state-of-the-art office in Bitola. I am really happy about that, and I can freely say that the company is experiencing stable growth and intensive development as never before. But our growth is effective and allows us to create and maintain a positive working environment which is absolutely essential for us.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>For years, Cosmic Development has been on the list of the most wanted companies to work for, according to employees. How do you stay ahead of the competition in a country with many IT companies, especially considering the Balkans' shortage of high-quality workers suitable for the global market?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are several factors at play. Above all, we practice a relaxed and positive working environment. We strive to introduce play-and-relax zones, flexible working hours, location flexibility, and good employee benefits packages that are regularly enhanced. Additionally, our employees are free from administrative micromanagement, which is key to preventing fatigue and killing their creativity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We also strive for openness and transparency toward our employees. Our honest relationship is incredibly important, and we recently put a lot of attention and focus on it. Our employees are always informed about our goals, achievements, and plans. We are always realistic - we never promise what we can't deliver, and most importantly, we are always fair and honest with the whole team, without exceptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are not perfect, and no business is, but the thing that helped us achieve success is that we are always learning from our mistakes and trying to improve for our employees and clients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7298,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/entoni2-1068x712-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7298"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Cosmic Development is oriented towards outsourcing a wide range of IT services. In your client's testimonials, mainly from the USA and Canada, one can read their impressions about your company. They say that the relationship you establish with your clients is of relational rather than transactional character, and your services are produced through interaction between the clients and the teams.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Yes, that's right. Our motto is: We build teams for brands! But that doesn't mean we only hire people who will work for a particular client and will be told what to do. Our way of working is characterized by a high level of trust between the company and the clients and cooperation and mutual respect between the clients and employees. Our clients want employees that will cooperate and give ideas and improvement suggestions that can have a significant impact. They want a team that can work jointly and effectively, not just anonymous workers from some corner of the world working on the given task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This combined effort is very serious, but it helps establish an effective collaboration where both parties are satisfied with their work. And a job that is completed successfully is crucial for clients and their businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Your growth and development allowed you to expand your services in the area of non-technical services (BPO). What types of services are most requested?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Besides IT, we also offer non-technical services or BPO. We are currently oriented towards this type of service because it provides greater flexibility than IT services. The IT part is always slower but with steadier growth because the market is very saturated and competitive. On the other hand, the BPO part allows us to grow and hire more people faster. Additionally, the current client base needs workers from this sector, which explains our continuous growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7299,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/entoni3-1068x712-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7299"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What is your company's potential, and what can Macedonia do to support the IT industry? How do other countries succeed in maintaining and developing this vital branch?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Macedonia has an exceptional and competitive IT industry. Getting a developer job, whether junior or senior, is much easier than before. This results from the growing number of tech businesses and their rising demand for tech talent, and we expect it to grow in the coming years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The pandemic has normalized remote work; now, many developers prefer remote work or freelancing. Our company has successfully adapted to the new reality, and we let our IT professionals choose their way of working.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Regarding the non-technical services we offer, I think Macedonia has unlimited potential in that area because the country has a young, talented, and educated workforce willing to work. That's why our institutions must recognize the best companies and try to keep them. It is also essential to ensure that companies that take advantage of favorable business conditions and pay their workers low salaries, like those in India, are not supported. The BPO services are an excellent possibility for the country's economic growth and can improve further if the workers are treated equally everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">And in terms of how other countries maintain and develop their IT sector, I wouldn't comment because it's not my area of expertise. However, investing in young people and their education and creating a favorable business climate for IT companies is never a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Your job is keeping you in Macedonia. So what are your impressions, what do you like, and have you adopted any local habits? What are the advantages and disadvantages of living in this part of the world?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Over the years, things changed, and now it is not only the job that keeps me here. I got married and have a child, so my family life is in Macedonia. And although I was born in the USA, I love Macedonia and life here. Like any place in the world, there are good and bad sides. It is not perfect, but nowhere is. I love the way of life here. Macedonia has relaxed and friendly people, and they can be excellent hosts. If I could, I would spend my days in a kafana, talking with people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another thing I like is its natural beauty. Macedonia has many incredible mountains, lakes, historical cities, and undoubtedly the most beautiful women, as you can see by&nbsp;my wife! As I've already mentioned, the downsides are only natural, but I never focus on them; I only see the good things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Under the right conditions, Macedonia has a vast potential to be a great place to live because it has a small territory and can quickly thrive, much easier than other countries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What are Cosmic Development's plans for the future, and what management strategies push companies forward? Please give us a little glimpse into the future.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development's next plan is to continue growing and create a positive and stimulating work environment where our teams can develop professionally. The future is unpredictable, but we are sure that we will continue to aspire to improve, collaborate, and treat our employees in the best possible way. We will continue building a <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/strong-company-culture-5-key-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong company culture</a> that will drive business success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The opening of the new office in Bitola is something that we are looking forward to and is a motivating factor for all of us. I believe that we are setting an example that will stimulate positive change in the life of this beautiful city which is a mecca for IT companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With this expansion, which is an investment in excellent working conditions, we will provide our employees with an exciting career journey, just like we always do, because we remain a company that is entirely committed to its people.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The modern workplace is an evolution of the traditional office experience characterized by a formal office structure, a lack of digital technology, and fixed working hours. Modern organizations are environments that have invested in advanced methodology and technology and are designed to meet the physical and technological needs of both the company and its employees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">But businesses don't just succeed because of technology; they succeed because of people, so the modern workplace is more than using sophisticated tools and technologies. At its essence, it's about using the right resources, opportunities, and motivation to help employees reach their full potential. It is employee-centric and stimulates an open, positive, collaborative, and flexible culture tailored for the modern worker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The combination of intelligent technology, efficient processes, and the human factor is the key to building workplaces of the future and is essential for the modern workplace to exist. When employees have the right environment, tools, and culture that encourages them to be creative and innovative, they will perform at their best and be the most productive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In today's blog, we will explore key characteristics that define the modern workplace that motivates and attracts modern-day workers and that you should look for when searching for a new job.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>An Engaged and Mobile Workforce</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today's workers don't want to be limited to a single location and tied to their desks. They expect flexibility and mobility when it comes to where and when they can work and be productive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Therefore, companies that want to stay connected and keep their workers engaged must implement a digital workplace strategy and empower employees with advanced tools and cloud platforms. Employees should have the most modern and up-to-date devices and secure access to company networks, documents, and communications systems to work effectively and efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This is an essential step toward improving the efficiency of an organization's business processes. Besides keeping employees engaged and satisfied, it will increase flexibility, agility, productivity, and revenue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Flexibility and Work-Life Balance</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Employees today put a great value on flexibility and well-being and are looking for companies and jobs that align with their values and support their lifestyles. They expect a schedule tailored to their specific needs that allows them to care for their physical and emotional health and childcare needs or gives them more family time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/cosmic-development-and-24hr-mk-talk-about-the-flexibility-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flexible working</a> can motivate employees and help them feel happier, healthier, and perform better. By taking the time to understand their employee's needs, companies will increase their ability to attract talent and improve morale and employee retention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Remote and Hybrid Work</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Remote or hybrid work is the number one trait of a successful modern workplace, and employees now expect this work policy as standard. According to a McKinsey survey, about <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/what-executives-are-saying-about-the-future-of-hybrid-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90% of organizations plan to combine remote and on-site working</a> as part of their long-term working strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">A remote company gives people the trust and the tools to do their jobs from anywhere and collaborate across different time zones. They have flexibility and freedom to organize their work and personal life, thus creating a better quality of life and increased productivity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The hybrid model, a mix of in-office and remote work, can offer even greater flexibility because it enables employees to choose the environment that makes them most productive. It is best for those who find it difficult to perform efficiently in a home office or feel isolated. They can enjoy both the autonomy of remote work and the social advantages of in-person interactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Which form of work is suitable for a company depends on the type and industry, so companies should consider which options work best for them and their employees.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Support Learning and Development and Offer Career Growth Opportunities</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Companies that build a culture of continuous learning and invest in training and development will stand out in the modern world. Encouraging employees to succeed in their current roles and eventually move up in their careers through professional development will stay at their current workplace longer and improve your organization's productivity.</p>

<h2><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Effective Collaboration and Open Communication</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Collaboration is at the heart of every company and is vital for business success and competitiveness. To facilitate open communication and seamless collaboration, modern companies need to provide people with digital tools to help them collaborate from anywhere, anytime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Today there is an abundance of collaborative tech tools available. Whether it is shared productivity tools and cloud apps, or video conferencing platforms and chat, they will significantly impact employee engagement, boost a team's morale and increase efficiency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Employee Benefits Packages</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Modern-day workers want to work for companies that have a people-first culture. Adequate compensation is no longer enough because time is as valuable an asset as money. They want the flexibility to have a personal life without sacrificing their freedom for their career. They expect work environments where they will feel valued, engaged, and trusted to do a good job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Consequently, organizations that want to attract and keep the best talent and have happier and more productive employees must prioritize employee benefits and perks. A well-thought-out benefits package is more than office snacks and ping-pong tables. It should have a visible impact on employees and address issues like burnout and poor physical and mental health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Some examples of quality employee benefits packages will include flexible working, health and life insurance, training and development, office perks, employee discounts, rewards and bonuses, and wellness benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hopefully, now you have a better grasp on what makes a modern workplace. In essence, it is a collaborative and<a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/strong-company-culture-5-key-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> flexible culture</a> suited to modern-day employees and enabled by digital technology and tools. It understands the needs of its people, empowers them to make the best of their workday, prioritizes employee well-being, and ensures an overall positive workplace experience.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before we jump into 2023, let's look at the most memorable accomplishments of the past year. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">2022, Cosmic Development's eleventh year of helping businesses level up, was accompanied by constant growth. We remained committed to building a better tomorrow for our clients and continued working hard to provide first-class services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Driven by our core values, we strived to make a positive impact with all of our activities and business decisions. We introduced many new ideas to our company and participated in numerous significant events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development welcomed many new team members and hoped to have a successful journey together in the years ahead. We recognized our team members' personal lives and their need for flexibility and growth. And we acknowledged their talent and their many contributions to our company.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Cosmic Development Continues Growing&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We continued building strong relationships with our clients throughout the year and remained committed to delivering the highest service and value. We've helped them grow and celebrated their successes. We successfully kicked off three new projects this year and welcomed one new client.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our HR team has been busy bringing on new team members that helped Cosmic grow all year. Our company began the year with 91 team members and finished with 152 highly skilled professionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We ensured that our team had the skills and knowledge needed to succeed and invested in training programs, mentorship opportunities, and professional development courses.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The secret to our growth is our investment in employee experience. Offering various benefits and employee perks tailored to the individual needs of our people has remained imperative.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Success is Best When it is Shared</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This year we have successfully conducted different internal events and created in-person moments. All our colleagues, new and old, finally had a chance to connect and bond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Some of the exciting events we did internally were the business visit and an informal dinner meeting with Cosmic Development's CEO and CFO, Ryan and Matt, as well as Rumble's CEO, Chris Pavlovski.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Additionally, we held our first in-person general meeting since the pandemic's start. And we organized two interactive soft skill workshops in Skopje and Bitola with the business and management consultant Mihail Kitanovski.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">After two years of missing out on team building, we organized team buildings in Serbia and Macedonia. It was an excellent opportunity to get together, build connections, improve communication and collaboration, and have a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The New Year activities are an essential part of our traditions. We ended 2022 in a big way and had one of the best New Year parties. There were cocktails, tasty food, great music, and dancing till the morning. Furthermore, we organized a New Year party for the youngest Cosmic members. We loved seeing our offices in Skopje and Bitola becoming happier, louder, and more lively, and we enjoyed all those big smiles and happy faces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Our People Are Our Greatest Asset</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As we look back on this year, we can't help but recognize the amazing group of people behind our company. Employee well-being, employee happiness, employee experience, and employee satisfaction are the terms that marked 2022 at Cosmic Development. They are a vital feature of our corporate culture and essential to the company's overall success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We continued encouraging open communication and listened to our employees to understand their needs and goals for the future. At the beginning of the year, we surveyed all employees to identify how, when, and where they work best. We used the survey results to create a concise and comprehensive hybrid work policy that meets the needs of our employees and our business. We invested in space and modern technology to bridge the physical and digital world and equipped our people with the tools they need to be productive, whether working from home or in the office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Employee well-being, work-life balance, and flexibility remained a priority this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We further developed our employee benefits strategy. Now, we offer private health insurance for all employees and close family members, a yearly budget for professional growth and learning and training programs, wellness benefits, employee recognition, reward programs, and subsidized healthy meal options. The list will grow in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We continued acknowledging their hard work and accomplishments and celebrated work anniversaries, new wins, new clients, birthdays, and much more. And we invested investment in networking, educational, and mentorship opportunities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Great work this year, and thank you for being such an integral part of our growth in 2022. We couldn't have done it without you!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Despite its reputation as a challenging and isolating job, working the night shift can offer a unique and fulfilling work experience that can help you grow personally and professionally. With benefits like quiet and peaceful work environments, reduced commute times, an opportunity to pursue personal interests and hobbies during the day, higher pay, and overall increased flexibility, working the night shift can be an unconventional approach to balancing work and play.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em><span style="color:#005b81" class="has-inline-color">Olivera</span>:</em></strong>&nbsp;Drink water every hour to stay hydrated, take short breaks to stretch and get fresh air, aim for at least eight hours of sleep, try to get some exercise like a jog, and maintain a healthy diet. These strategies have been incredibly helpful to me during my night shifts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>2. How do you communicate effectively with team members and manage tasks during the night shift?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em><span style="color:#005b81" class="has-inline-color">Filip</span>:</em></strong>&nbsp;Yes, enduring the entire shift can sometimes be tough, but taking care of yourself and having a positive outlook can help. It may be a different schedule, but it's just as doable as any other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em><span style="color:#005b81" class="has-inline-color">Olivera</span>:</em></strong>&nbsp;I prefer the night shift because it aligns better with my lifestyle.

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Companies can stand out in today's hyper-competitive job market by offering exceptional employee benefits that go above and beyond the industry standard. With the pandemic's onset, employee benefits became even more evident as employees faced new challenges, including remote work, mental health concerns, and increased financial uncertainty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Companies that offered flexible work, health support, and other benefits were better equipped to meet the needs of their employees during this time. And in return, they had happier, more engaged, and more productive employees. Employee benefits have emerged as a critical factor in building a strong and healthy workforce, and companies that prioritize them are likely to be more successful. Now they are essential to any company's strategy to attract and retain top talent. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">At Cosmic Development, we know our employees are our biggest asset, and we're dedicated to their well-being. That's why we have developed a comprehensive benefits package that includes work-life balance, health and wellness, and professional development opportunities. Whether you're searching for a new career opportunity or you are an employer looking to enhance your benefits package, read on to discover what sets Cosmic Development apart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Work-Life Balance Benefits</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The need for a healthy work-life balance has become more necessary than ever. While salary and financial compensation remain important, many employees prioritize balancing their personal and professional lives over earning more money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We at Cosmic Development recognize the importance of offering work-life balance benefits and feel a strong responsibility to help our teams juggle the demands of their work and personal lives because even the most engaged employees may sometimes struggle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":30} -->

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7479,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":30} -->
<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We understand that our people have different needs and responsibilities outside of work. Therefore, we give them the flexibility in the work environment&nbsp;they need. We offer flexible work arrangements, including remote work options, and encourage them to focus on productivity rather than hours. That allows them to manage their time better, reduce stress, and increase their overall job satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Health and Wellness Benefits</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another vital part of building a strong and healthy workforce is supporting our employees' physical and mental health because we believe a healthy workforce is productive. This benefit helps our employees focus on their work without worrying about their health and well-being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">All our employees have access to private health insurance. Additionally, we provide health insurance for the employees' immediate families to ensure their loved ones are covered. Cosmic Development also offers a life insurance benefit at no cost to employees. Life insurance provides financial security to employees and their families in unforeseen circumstances. It also means peace of mind, reducing stress, and improving job focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Moreover, the company provides a monthly budget that allows employees to personalize their experience and engage in activities that best align with their interests and needs. Thus, they can choose from various options, including sports activities through gym membership, participating in sports events, utilizing wellness, beauty, and spa services, or spending their budget on purchasing literature, computer glasses, and IT equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Professional Development Benefits</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The importance of professional development benefits has never been more apparent than in today's rapidly changing business landscape. As technology evolves and competition intensifies, keeping employees current with technology equips them with the resources they need to excel in their positions and helps them prepare for future responsibilities within the company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Staff development is another fundamental aspect of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/strong-company-culture-5-key-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmic Development's company culture</a>. We invest a lot of time and resources to help our employees progress on their individual career paths.

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As the Digital Marketing Manager and Content Creator for the Signature Sold Group, I can say that working in the real estate industry is incredibly dynamic and fast-paced. Because the real estate industry is constantly changing, digital marketing plays a critical role in the success of any real estate business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In order to be successful in this industry, it is essential to be up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies and have a deep understanding of the target audience. Real estate buyers and sellers have unique needs and preferences, and our job, as digital creators and marketers, is to develop customized content and strategies that meet those needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the most challenging aspects of working in real estate digital marketing is the level of competition in the industry. A lot of companies are vying for the attention of potential buyers and sellers, and it is essential to create innovative and eye-catching content and campaigns that set my client apart from the rest.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">At the same time, working in real estate digital marketing has many rewarding aspects. It is incredibly satisfying to see the positive impact of our efforts on our clients' lives and to know that we are helping them achieve their real estate goals. The real estate industry is also full of exciting and engaging projects, from developing marketing campaigns for luxury properties to creating compelling social media content that resonates with buyers and sellers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->

<h2><strong>Looking back, what's been the most exciting and challenging thing you have ever faced?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the most challenging and exciting projects I worked on in recent years was a rebranding campaign for the Signature Sold Group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The client had been in the industry for many years and had a strong reputation, but they wanted to refresh their brand and better reflect their values and mission. As the Digital Marketing Manager, I created and implemented a comprehensive digital marketing campaign to help them achieve their goals. We also developed new social media channels and created a targeted advertising campaign to increase visibility and engagement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of our biggest challenges was maintaining consistency and continuity throughout the campaign. We had to ensure that all aspects of the brand, from the website to social media to advertising, were aligned with the client's values and messaging.</p>

<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, despite the challenges, the campaign was incredibly rewarding. The new website and social media channels were well-received, and the targeted advertising campaign generated high engagement and interest from potential buyers and sellers. It was an excellent reminder of the power of digital marketing and the importance of creating cohesive and consistent branding strategies.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Frameworks are a necessary part of every frontend and backend development. No matter what language or tools you use, a framework can help make your life easier as a programmer. One software development framework that has stood the test of time and remains relevant today is .NET.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Developed by Microsoft in 2002,.NET is a full-stack framework that provides a rich set of tools and libraries for building a wide range of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, and gaming applications. With its versatility, compatibility with high-level languages, and extensive documentation and support, .NET development is a great tool to help you develop efficient and reliable software solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In today's blog post, we will dive deeper into .NET development, explore its benefits, and learn why it is a great career choice for software developers in today's tech industry. From high demand and versatility to a large community and support, it's a skill that every developer should add to their arsenal.</p>

<h2><strong>High Demand for .NET Developers</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although .NET has been around for over two decades, it's still going strong. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a>&nbsp;published in 2022, .NET has been on top of the most popular frameworks list for three consecutive years (2019, 2020, and 2021), with 34.55 % of the vote in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Its use has been growing steadily over the years. Today, developers and organizations worldwide widely use it, and there is a growing demand for .NET developers in the market.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics</a>, the employment rate for software developers is projected to increase by 25% from 2021 to 2030, indicating that the demand for skilled .Net developers continues to grow significantly. In recent years, the growth of cloud computing has further driven the need. It is a popular choice for organizations that want to move their applications to the cloud, as it provides a reliable and secure platform for hosting applications and services. The .NET framework is fully compatible with popular cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, allowing developers to create cloud-based applications that can scale quickly and efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">.NET has evolved significantly over the years, adapting to the industry's ever-changing demands. And as it continues to evolve, with the recent release of&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-7">.NET 7</a>, it will likely remain competitive and relevant for many years. Given that, investing time and effort in mastering .NET can set you apart and substantially increase your chances of securing employment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Job Security</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">As mentioned earlier, .NET was ranked as the most popular framework among developers, and the demand for skilled .NET developers is expected to grow in the coming years. Companies across industries will continue to rely on .NET developers to build and maintain their applications. And all that translates to job security for those with the necessary skills and experience.</p>

<h2><strong>Versatility of the .NET Framework</strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the key advantages of .NET is its versatility and flexibility. It supports multiple programming languages, including C#, F#, and Visual Basic, and allows developers to build applications for various platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile devices. Furthermore, the .NET platform provides diverse development frameworks and tools that empower developers to personalize and enhance their applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another advantage of .NET is its ability to integrate with other technologies and platforms. For example, .NET provides seamless integration with Microsoft Azure, a cloud computing platform that allows developers to host and scale their applications easily. .NET also offers integration with popular development tools such as Visual Studio, a robust integrated development environment (IDE) that supports code editing, debugging, and testing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This flexibility has made .NET popular for developers who want to create cross-platform applications running on different operating systems and devices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Large Community and Support</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">.NET development is supported by a vast and active developer community, which makes it easier to find help and support when needed. Numerous online resources, such as forums, blogs, and tutorials, provide information on .NET development and best practices. Additionally, Microsoft provides extensive documentation and support for .NET development, making it easier for developers to learn and stay up-to-date on the latest technologies. Whether you're an experienced developer or a beginner, you'll be able to find enough support to help you learn and grow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Free and Open Source&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">.NET is free and open-source. With access to the source code, developers can modify it to suit their specific needs and get support from the open-source community. The open-source nature of .NET has resulted in the creation of a vast ecosystem of tools and libraries that enable developers to build powerful and scalable applications easily. And by eliminating the need to create and manage infrastructure, .NET's open-source nature simplifies development and deployment, leading to cost savings and faster time-to-market.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Easy to Deploy and Maintain</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">.NET is easy to deploy and maintain, a significant advantage that makes it a top choice for developers and businesses. The platform's modular design allows developers to easily update and fix individual components of an application without having to navigate through complex scripts, which means that issues can be resolved quickly and efficiently, saving time and effort. The platform also offers a range of tools and libraries that make the deployment process simple and easy, helping to ensure that applications are up and running smoothly.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Conclusion: Is .NET a good career choice for software developers in 2023 and beyond?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The answer is YES. It is safe to say that .NET is a good career choice for software developers in 2023 and beyond. With its broad scope and versatility, .NET has proven to be a reliable, secure, and powerful framework suitable for all types of software applications, from small to enterprise-level.

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Maja:</strong> Never stop learning - easily done when your company never stops investing in you and offers you the luxury of access to multiple paid platforms with excellent courses for each relevant field. I've been enjoying this L&amp;D luxury for months at Cosmic Development, including outstanding Udemy courses on IT recruiting and IT for recruiters, but also the incredible Irina Shamaeva, Mike Santoro, MBA, and David Galley's books full of Sourcing Hacks, Boolean Strings, and X-Ray Search! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am grateful for being provided with all the resources I could ever ask for in order to learn, upgrade and constantly improve my skills as a sourcer and recruiter. Cosmic Development doesn't just care for our intellectual growth but also our emotional development, communication, interpersonal skills, and the capability to work together as one big happy family! Hence, the investment in several rounds of workshops and training on topics such as empathy, holding difficult conversations, listening, etc. Cosmic's learning and development <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-employee-benefits-help-building-a-strong-and-healthy-workforce/" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits </a>never neglect the human factor because we are people first and employees second.

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Kosta</strong>: Since opening in 2011, Cosmic Development has always had high values for its employees. That's why one of the "oldest" benefits in the company is the ability to give employees the option of constant learning and improvement through its program: paid online courses or visiting seminars, trainings, etc. This benefit provides the ability to expand skill sets, increase skill and knowledge retention, generate ideas, boost morale, and raise overall employee performance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the individual level, this can help achieve career development goals, obtain or update professional licenses or certifications, and explore new perspectives to approaching work. To the company, this benefit contributes to organizational goals forward-thinking innovation culture in the workplace. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I recently finished an online course for the advanced use of the automation framework Cypress. Upon completing the course, I could better understand the framework and build more reliable automation tests for any web application. The course also included articles for JavaScript so that best coding practices for Cypress tests can be implemented. I would not stop here because constant learning is crucial for this line of work and helps maintain a marketable professional skill set.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Ivana:</strong> Continuous learning and development are vital for personal and professional growth. They allow individuals to remain updated with the latest industry developments and best practices, which is crucial in today's fast-paced and ever-changing work environment.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Participating in the Emotional Intelligence in the Workplace training was an incredibly valuable experience for me. Emotional intelligence is a critical skill that every manager and leader must possess. Effective communication, conflict resolution, and team management rely on emotional intelligence. Understanding and managing our emotions and empathizing with others can develop stronger relationships with our team and foster a positive work environment. The training gave me a deeper understanding of these concepts and equipped me with practical tools and techniques to apply daily with my team. The training was engaging, informative, and immensely helpful in making me a better colleague and, ultimately, a better person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I believe that investing in employee training and development is beneficial not only for the employees but also for the company. A well-trained and highly skilled workforce can help organizations stay competitive, innovate, and achieve long-term success. Companies must prioritize employee development, and I am grateful to be part of a company that values and supports the growth of its people.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Tome:</strong> Learning and development are essential to personal and professional growth. Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in a one-day data security and safety training. As a security analyst, this experience was really valuable because I learned a lot about the latest regulations in our country that affect my work and how to adapt to changing circumstances. Also, it was great to network with professionals from different companies in the field. I really hope that I will have the opportunity to attend similar trainings abroad. It would be a fantastic opportunity to expand my knowledge and experiences even more.</p>

<h2><strong>Empowering Our Workforce through Dynamic Soft Skills Workshops</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development has always been a company that acknowledges the importance of investing in our employees' knowledge and skills.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The workshops have covered a wide range of topics, from Effective Communication Skills and Holding Difficult Conversations to Dealing With Difficult People, Emotional Intelligence and Empathy Skills.

<h2><strong>Why is Emotional Intelligence Necessary in the Workplace?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Emotional intelligence is a critical factor that significantly influences individual and organizational success. <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Studies conducted by the World Economic Forum</a> have shown that 90% of top performers in various industries have high levels of emotional intelligence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Moreover, <a href="https://www.talentsmarteq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TalentSmart's study</a> found that emotional intelligence surpasses 33 other critical workplace skills as the strongest predictor of performance, accounting for an impressive 58% of success in all job types.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">This highlights that technical expertise alone is no longer sufficient to thrive in today's corporate setting. Cultivating a workplace culture that values emotional intelligence establishes a strong foundation for long-term success, fostering happier, more productive, highly engaged employees.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">As the temperatures rise and vacation plans start taking shape, you may find staying focused and motivated at work challenging. However, with the right strategies and mindset, you can balance enjoying the summer season and being productive at work. Let's explore practical ways to make the most of this sunny time while ensuring you stay on top of your professional game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Why Does Summer Make Us Less Productive?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://epic.uchicago.edu/news/hot-temperatures-decrease-worker-productivity-economic-output/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a>&nbsp;has found that working in hot weather becomes more challenging. It's not just a feeling; heat can affect our brains, making it harder to think clearly and perform tasks requiring logical reasoning. This decline in productivity isn't limited to work; it can also impact mental performance and decision-making, even while driving. So, when you feel less energetic and motivated during hot weather, there's a scientific reason behind it, not just a lack of interest in work. Coupled with vacations and a relaxed atmosphere, this can lead to a noticeable drop in productivity during the summer.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Set Clear Goals and Priorities</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Setting clear goals and priorities maximizes workplace productivity during the summer. Identify essential tasks and deadlines, and create a structured daily or weekly to-do list. Avoid procrastination by staying disciplined and committed to completing your assignments on time. Remember to set realistic expectations and monitor your progress to keep on track. Be flexible in adjusting your goals when necessary to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. By sticking to these objectives, you'll find the perfect balance between work and summer fun and make your season more fulfilling and productive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Embrace Flexible Work Arrangements</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you want to make the most of your summer season and stay productive at work, embracing flexible work arrangements, such as workations, is the way to go. You can improve your work-life balance by having the flexibility to change when and where you work. Whether remote work or flexible hours, these options let you participate in summer events, spend time with loved ones, pursue personal interests, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/the-perks-of-remote-work-summer-workations-at-cosmic-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take a staycation while working from home</a>. Not only will it reduce commuting stress, but it will also boost your morale, leading to increased engagement and productivity. Don't worry about decreased performance –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/283985/working-remotely-effective-gallup-research-says-yes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a>&nbsp;show that employees with flexible arrangements tend to be more efficient and produce higher-quality work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Utilize Time Management Techniques</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>"Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today."- Benjamin Franklin</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Amidst the summer buzz and distractions, effective time management becomes crucial for maintaining productivity. Plan your day wisely with clear task priorities and time blocks. Try different time management techniques. Explore the&nbsp;<a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pomodoro Technique</a>&nbsp;for focused intervals and breaks. Also, you can consider the <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time Blocking Method</a>, the <a href="https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eisenhower Matrix</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done#:~:text=The%20GTD%20method%20rests%20on,items%20with%20known%20time%20limits." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Getting Things Done (GTD) Method</a>, among many others.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Set achievable goals and celebrate your progress. Avoid multitasking to maintain efficiency, and use time-blocking for a structured workday. Minimize time-wasting activities like excessive social media and non-essential tasks. And don't forget to rest and recharge because a well-rested mind is productive. With this balanced approach, you can conquer the summer productivity slump, make the most of work, and play under the sun's warm rays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Respect Your Time Off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Taking needed breaks from work isn't just a luxury but an investment in your long-term health and well-being. Regular time off doesn't just recharge your batteries; it also sharpens your focus and sparks creativity. It's a proven stress reducer and helps you feel more satisfied at work and in your relationships. By prioritizing breaks, you're keeping burnout at bay, creating a solid work-life balance, and giving yourself space to grow.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What inspired you to pursue a career as a full-stack developer?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have always had a passion for technology and problem-solving from a young age. Growing up, I was fascinated by computers and how they worked. Delving deeper into the world of technology, I realized that building web applications and websites can be a powerful way to create meaningful and interactive experiences for people.</p>

<h2><strong>What attracted you to join Cosmic Development?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Reputation and culture, working on challenging projects, work-life balance, collaborative environment, opportunities for remote work, flexible working hours, and benefits are some of the main factors that pulled me to join Cosmic Development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Could you share your overall experience at Cosmic and your experience so far?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I joined Cosmic Development, I started working on a Laravel project, which was something new for me. Still, my previous experience with the Sails.JS framework and PHP was a sound basis for me to quickly master the Laravel Framework and become responsible for the entire project.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Tell us more about your current project - the Internal HR software tool, the first product of Cosmic Development.</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Share your experience as a mentor for the internship program at Cosmic Development.&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a mentor comes with various challenges due to the technical nature of the field and the diverse range of skills and experiences that mentors need to have, like good communication and leadership skills. As Cosmic Development's internship mentor, I aim to help interns become proficient programmers and develop a strong foundation in programming principles and practices. Last year, we successfully finished our first internship program with students from the Technical High School "Gjorgji Naumov" from Bitola. I am happy that students could build their first application at the end of this internship program. Next year, we continue with another internship program to help the young generation find their path in the IT field.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is Dragan outside the office?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Out of the office, I'm a father of two kids and always on the move, trying to handle all my responsibilities and keep a good and healthy life balance at the same time. I love spending time with my family and playing video games with my kids.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I love to travel and make plans for my next trip. My next destination is Lisbon, Portugal. I love to spend my time in the mountains for the winter weekends to ski and make snowballs with my kids. When the snow recedes, I start to prepare for the upcoming marathons.  I just ran 21km half-marathon on TrcajBe, my next target is a 42 km marathon. My guitar and my bike are still my good old friends. Reading a good book is always welcome. Latest read: Atomic Habits by James Clear. Also, drinking good coffee with friends is something that I usually do.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Optimizing our daily workflow and productivity has become essential in a world where every second counts. The digital age has brought forth a new era of possibilities thanks to the revolutionary advancements in artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In recent months, you've likely heard about a remarkable digital tool changing how we approach work and productivity. Its name is ChatGPT, and it's not just another buzzword in the tech world; it's a game-changer for anyone striving to make the most of their day. The great thing is that it's accessible to everyone, no matter their level of technical knowledge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this blog post, we'll dive into the world of ChatGPT, exploring its remarkable capabilities. But before we get into it, let's take a moment to understand what ChatGPT is all about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What is ChatGPT?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">ChatGPT is a groundbreaking AI-powered tool developed by OpenAI. This versatile digital assistant utilizes advanced natural language processing to generate human-like text responses, boosting productivity and efficiency. ChatGPT's capabilities extend beyond answering questions; it can provide creative inspiration, learn from feedback, and handle tasks like writing various content types, text summarization, machine translation, and code generation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It's available in a free tier and a paid subscription plan. ChatGPT Plus, priced at $20 per month, provides extra advantages, including quicker response times, priority access to new features and improvements, and higher API usage limits. It's important to note that ChatGPT is not up to date and was trained using data up to September 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The possibilities are vast, and you can&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://chat.openai.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">explore ChatGPT</a>&nbsp;for free on its website or dive deeper into its features on the accompanying&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/blog" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>.</p>

<ul style="font-size:22px"><li><strong><span style="color:#364693" class="has-inline-color">Writing Assistant and Content Creation</span></strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">ChatGPT can be your invaluable writing assistant and content creation tool, offering assistance and inspiration beyond simple text generation. It elevates the quality of your content, helping you craft well-structured, coherent, and engaging writing pieces. Whether you're tackling marketing campaigns, research papers, customer emails, or any other written task, ChatGPT can offer suggestions for phrasing, help organize your thoughts, and even provide examples or data to support your arguments.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Its versatility extends to various content types, including articles, blog posts, marketing content, social media captions, CVs, and cover letters, and it can even be used for creative endeavors like songwriting, poetry, scriptwriting, and recipes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, remember that ChatGPT is an AI, so while it can produce remarkably human-like content, fine-tuning and double-checking the facts, statistics, and claims, along with adding your personal touch, remains vital for achieving the best results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"},"color":{"text":"#364693"}}} -->
<ul class="has-text-color" style="color:#364693;font-size:22px"><li><strong>Proofreading and Editing&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">ChatGPT is an excellent tool for proofreading and editing. It detects and corrects spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors and improves the clarity and coherence of your writing, making sure you quickly write error-free documents. It also suggests ways to rephrase sentences and restructure paragraphs. Plus, it helps you learn from your common writing mistakes and enhance your skills over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">But again, keep in mind that although ChatGPT can give you valuable suggestions, you should not see it as a complete replacement for human proofreaders. Humans still have contextual understanding, creativity, and nuanced language skills that AI can't replicate. Therefore, combining ChatGPT's capabilities with human expertise ensures the highest quality of writing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"22px"},"color":{"text":"#364693"}}} -->
<ul class="has-text-color" style="color:#364693;font-size:22px"><li><strong>Coding Assistant</strong></li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Regardless of your level of experience in coding, ChatGPT is a powerful tool for coding and testing. It can generate code snippets, sample code, and complete programming code in natural language. This feature is handy for speeding up application development and debugging.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">With ChatGPT, developers can quickly draft app structures, make adjustments, and even ask questions about their projects, simplifying the development process. It can also assist with documentation and technical writing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Plus, ChatGPT serves as a learning resource, explaining programming concepts and offering step-by-step tutorials to improve coding skills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">While it excels at generating code and can save time and effort, ChatGPT is not a replacement for human programmers, as it may need more emotional intelligence to handle complex programming tasks. Additionally, it may have limitations in context understanding and language support. However, it offers a versatile and efficient way to create code, making it a valuable resource for developers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">ChatGPT can help you simplify complex topics and summarize long texts. It can explain complicated information clearly and concisely, making it easier for different audiences to understand. It can also shorten texts while keeping the main ideas, making it useful for quickly getting important information from large documents, research papers, or articles.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">ChatGPT can help you with meeting notes and preparation. It can create clear and concise agendas for your meetings, take notes and capture the main points, decisions, and action items, summarize the key points and generate a summary report, and follow up on action items by creating and tracking tasks. It can also help you learn from your meetings and improve your skills. This feature saves time, boosts <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/productivity-tips-how-to-stay-productive-while-working-from-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">productivity</a>, and promotes effective communication. But always remember, especially in important or sensitive meetings, that using your judgment and carefully checking your notes for accuracy and completeness is vital.</p>

<h2><strong>Additional Uses&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">ChatGPT has many other useful applications besides the ones we discussed. It can help you learn and practice different languages by talking to you in a natural way. It can also be your creative partner, giving you ideas for artwork, novel plots, or even unique business ventures. Furthermore, it excels at explaining historical events and their importance, making it an excellent tool for research or education. ChatGPT can also help you with math problems, showing you how to solve complex equations or simplify math concepts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Whether you want to plan a trip or find a good restaurant, ChatGPT can give you travel tips and local insights.

<h2><strong>Tips for Effective Prompts&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">To make the most of ChatGPT, it's essential to craft effective prompts. Prompts are phrases or instructions you give the ChatGPT to generate a response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Be Clear and Specific:</strong>&nbsp;Start your prompt with a clear intention and specific request. For example, if you want tips for a new product launch, you can say,&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">     "Generate three actionable tips for launching a new tech gadget."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Provide Context:</strong>&nbsp;Including relevant background information helps ChatGPT understand your request. For example:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">     "I'm planning a trip to Paris. Suggest some must-visit places and local cuisine recommendations."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Use Natural Language:</strong>&nbsp;Frame your prompts in a conversational way. Think of it as a question or instruction you'd give to a friend:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">      "Explain the concept of dark matter."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">      "Share your insights on the influence of social media on mental health."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Focus on a Single Topic:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep your prompts focused on one topic or idea. Consider breaking them into separate prompts if you have multiple questions or requests because that will make it easier for ChatGPT to generate meaningful responses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Include Keywords:</strong>&nbsp;If there are specific keywords or phrases you want in the response, mention them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">       "Create a marketing slogan for a fitness brand that emphasizes 'strength' and 'vitality."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">       "Suggest ways to improve time management for students preparing for exams."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Keep It Concise:</strong>&nbsp;While being specific is crucial, avoid lengthy prompts. Concise prompts are easier for ChatGPT to understand and respond to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">     "Provide three budget-friendly recipe ideas for a vegetarian dinner."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Test and Refine:</strong>&nbsp;Don't hesitate to iterate and refine your prompts if you're not getting the desired response. Experiment with different phrasings and approaches to find what works best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Remember that while crafting effective prompts is essential, ChatGPT may still need to produce accurate or fictional information. Verifying the information generated is a good practice, especially for critical tasks.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Team building plays a significant role in enhancing a company's performance and success. When employees in a company work well together, trust each other, and communicate effectively, it improves collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability. This, in turn, can boost productivity, innovation, and overall company success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Team building is more than just “the most anticipated event” at Cosmic Development; it's a core part of who we are. We recently gathered for our first big team building since the pandemic, and it was a day filled with fun, growth, and togetherness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">From September 29th to October 1st, our teams from Bitola, Skopje, and Belgrade offices came together for a remarkable three-day team building in the beautiful Aegean coastline near Ouranoupoli in Greece. It was more than just a getaway; it was a reaffirmation of our commitment to employee well-being and teamwork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Building Bonds: Teamwork and Communication at the Beach</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We strongly emphasized effective communication during our team building as we engaged in various activities designed to enhance our teamwork and problem-solving skills.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The event started with an icebreaker that set the tone and divided our group into teams, intentionally breaking up cliques and fostering new connections among participants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These newly formed teams then engaged in a series of competitive team-building exercises, each earning points for the teams. The winning team was the one that had the most points overall at the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The team-building started with the "Hula Hoop Challenge," a fun activity that set the mood for the event. With over 100 employees present, we all gathered in a circle, eager to take on the challenge. The aim was not only to successfully pass the Hula Hoop around the circle while maintaining our handhold unbroken but also to promote unity, camaraderie, and teamwork spirit. We enjoyed ourselves and laughed as we cooperated to solve the challenge, demonstrating the importance of creative problem-solving and effective teamwork. This game was a perfect way to start the team-building event, as it strengthened the bonds among employees and reinforced the idea that working together can be both productive and fun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the "Back-to-Back Communication Game," we tackled an interesting challenge. Each group was given a unique drawing, ensuring no two groups had the same. This setup provided a valuable lesson on the importance of creativity and the subjective nature of communication. Through this exercise, we all gained a profound appreciation for the crucial role that clear communication plays in achieving the desired results. As we used drawings on the backs of our team members to convey specific words or phrases, it became apparent just how easy misinterpretation can occur. It underscored the necessity of clear communication and effective teamwork within a group.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">We also enjoyed the "Balloon Race," an interactive activity that involved forming a human train to transport balloons without using our hands. This game highlights the importance of individual contributions and effective team organization, as the activity's success relies on both. Each team needs to work cohesively, ensuring they synchronize their movements to transport the balloons without mishaps. This challenge encouraged us to collaborate seamlessly to maintain the train formation while keeping the balloons intact. The "Balloon Race" is a well-liked team-building exercise, combining elements of coordination, teamwork, and friendly competition.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The "Beach Bucket Challenge" added another exciting dimension to our activities. This challenge revolved around finding the most effective means to collect and transport as much water as possible from the beach, testing our creativity, adaptability, and speed. The essence was to see how resourceful each team could be when they have limited resources at their disposal. It encouraged creative problem-solving and teamwork, making the most of what we had on hand and underlining the value of thinking on our feet to accomplish the task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">These activities strengthened our communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills while fostering new relationships and having fun.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition to our team-building activities, we had some enjoyable informal gatherings and evenings, which allowed us to relax and socialize more casually.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the first night, we hosted a "Cosmic Party" at the Beach Bar with a DJ, creating an evening of music and dancing for everyone to unwind and enjoy. This lively gathering also provided the perfect moment to present loyalty awards and honor our employees' loyalty and continuous dedication to our company. It was a chance to thank them for their years of service and for sticking with us through thick and thin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The second evening was even more fun, with a lively karaoke activity. We were divided into five groups, and each group got to draw a ticket with the name of a musical star or group. The options included ABBA, Spice Girls, Aqua, Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson. Each team was assigned to create an entire event around their chosen star or group, including costumes, choreography, and visual effects. It was a creative and spirited competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The teams competed in three categories, with a jury committee scoring them for the best choreography, best costume design, and the overall best stage performance. This activity sparked our creativity and teamwork, resulting in some fantastic and entertaining performances. After the karaoke competition, we continued the celebration with a poolside party.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">We also had plenty of free time to enjoy the beach, ensuring a well-rounded and enjoyable experience.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Corporate philanthropy, the practice of businesses giving back to society, is a powerful force for positive change in the world. Beyond their primary goal of generating profits and shareholder value, many companies today recognize the importance of making a meaningful contribution to their communities and the world. This practice extends beyond the traditional concept of charity, demonstrating a broader, more strategic approach.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this article, we'll delve into why a strategic approach through corporate philanthropy matters and highlight Cosmic Development's philanthropic initiatives as a positive example that may inspire or serve as a starting point for others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Corporate Philanthropy and Why It Matters</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Corporate philanthropy is more than charity; it's a strategic imperative for companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Adopting a strategic approach to corporate giving involves aligning donations with a company's mission, vision, values, and goals. This deliberate connection ensures that philanthropic efforts are purposeful, impactful, and directly tied to the company's identity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Efficiency is key. Strategic allocation of resources not only maximizes positive effects for both business and beneficiaries and enhances a company's social impact and competitive edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Moreover, the approach requires a fundamental shift in how companies view their societal role, engaging in dialogue with stakeholders to identify relevant issues. It's about purposeful change in management processes and practices, emphasizing sustainable development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Adopting a strategic approach to corporate philanthropy is necessary for businesses aiming to nurture a sustainable and socially responsible future.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Practices-2-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7786"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":20} -->
<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Corporate Philanthropy's Impact on Company Culture</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Corporate philanthropy is vital in shaping a <a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/strong-company-culture-5-key-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company's culture</a> and promoting meaningful employee engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">When a company embraces philanthropy strategically, weaving it into the core of its values and practices, it catalyzes positive change. Giving back fosters a sense of purpose and pride among employees, creating a shared commitment to making a difference. As individuals within the company see their collective efforts contributing to meaningful causes, it instills a sense of community and shared values. Moreover, corporate philanthropy can be a powerful talent attraction and retention tool as employees increasingly seek employers with a genuine commitment to social responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">By understanding and integrating corporate philanthropy into the broader context of company culture, organizations contribute to societal well-being and cultivate a workplace environment that inspires and unites its workforce toward a common, socially responsible goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Cosmic Development's Philanthropic Practices&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development exemplifies how corporate philanthropy can impact the lives of employees and the community. By integrating philanthropy into our core identity, we have established a holistic approach to giving, fostering a more compassionate society through education, inclusion, and employee-backed philanthropy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development helps communities in different ways, including supporting families, youth programs, environmental responsibility, employee ideas, and sports events. We aim to make a lasting impact by addressing specific needs and finding long-term solutions. We involve our employees in community welfare through their initiatives. Our approach to philanthropy distinguishes between immediate help, like giving food and clothing, and a more strategic plan extending to the middle and long term. This involves working closely with NGOs for lasting aid systems and impactful partnerships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In recognition of our dedicated efforts, we are honored to inform you that we have been recognized as a prime example of corporate philanthropy in Macedonia, alongside Makedonski Telekom, Komercijalna Banka, NLB Banka, Pivara AD Skopje, and Pakomak. This recognition comes as a result of our participation in the initiative for best practices organized by the Association Konekt and AmCham as part of USAID's Partnership for Giving Project. This initiative's primary goal is to emphasize philanthropy's significance nationally. Being one of the six recognized AmCham members for this cause fills us with pride and hope that our philanthropic endeavors will make a meaningful impact and inspire others to take action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Navigating the Path to Success: Cosmic Development's Five Pillars of Philanthropy</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Cosmic Development's philanthropic strategy is anchored in five comprehensive pillars, each with a specific focus.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->

<p class="has-medium-font-size">We at Cosmic Development value people over numbers, and today, we're excited to continue our series, introducing the remarkable individuals shaping our company.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the spotlight is Nick Naumoff, an experienced Content Editor at Rumble. This isn't Nick's first interview for our blog. In the initial piece, he provided invaluable insights into his career development, reflected on significant achievements, and discussed the challenges of managing viral video content. (You can revisit his first interview&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cosmicdevelopment.com/blog/how-rumbles-content-editor-chooses-the-best-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Celebrating a decade at Cosmic Development, Nick Naumoff has witnessed the transformative evolution of digital content and online platforms. From his early days contributing to Rumble's growth as a Content Manager to his current role as a Content Editor, Nick's journey unfolds as a testament to adaptability and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3><strong><em>Happy 10th anniversary in Cosmic. Can you compare your initial role in the dedicated team for Rumble and now as a manager? Can you share some key experiences or challenges from both standpoints that shaped your career at Cosmic Development?</em></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Back then, at the birth of Rumble, my responsibilities were very simple. We were a brand new platform, and no one knew who we were. Aside from posting to social media, I would find viral videos (cute pets, funny babies, time-lapse videos, etc.) and recruit them to upload to Rumble. So much has evolved since then. Nowadays, I'm able to offer a helping hand in many different departments (moderation, support, recruitment, legal, etc.). I feel that simply putting in the time and absorbing the knowledge over the past ten years has helped me in my managerial skills. I saw how my bosses could teach and motivate me, and in turn, I could apply that to my team. I'm able to learn from my mistakes and share that knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong><em>Moving to Florida to work directly with our biggest client is a significant shift. How has the experience been so far?</em></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Absolutely incredible. Unbelievable. I truly never thought I'd be living back in the States, let alone beautiful Florida, but here I am. Duty calls. And it's been nothing short of amazing since the day I've arrived. I was nervous, but building such close relationships with my colleagues at Rumble helped make the transition very easy. And being in Florida is paradise. No matter how bad of a day you may have at the office, you see nothing but palm trees and oceanfront on your drive home. Can't complain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong><em>How do you ensure effective communication with your team while managing a significant role remotely?</em></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It's all about my team leaders. They are the only reason I could accept this offer to move to Florida. I left Macedonia knowing the moderation team was in good hands, and they haven't let me down. I do my best to keep in touch with them (weekly meetings, phone calls, etc.) to avoid breaking that communication. They've stepped up in a big way. And again, I saw how my bosses from Toronto successfully managed me. It's come full circle for me.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong><em>How has video content changed over the years, and what new trends do you think are particularly noteworthy?</em></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">It's drastically changed. Since we consume so much content through our phones, short form vertical videos are what most of us are watching these days. Ten years ago, it wasn't really a thing. But now, especially for Rumble, live streaming is a huge deal. It's what the biggest content creators on the planet are prioritizing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong><em>As you look to the future, what goals or aspirations do you have for the Moderation Team and yourself within the company?</em></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">For myself, I just want to do my best to help Rumble become bigger and better. For the moderation team, I want them to put in the time and effort to be comfortable with the decisions they make. To have that confidence from the experience of filtering through so many videos. This way, they can use their critical thinking skills and help contribute to the further success of Rumble. They have done a phenomenal job so far, so I see nothing but good things in the future.&nbsp;</p>

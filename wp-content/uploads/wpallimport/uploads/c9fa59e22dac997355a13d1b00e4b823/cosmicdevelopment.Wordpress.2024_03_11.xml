<h3><strong>Congratulations on reaching the milestone of 10 years at Cosmic Development, Vesna!&nbsp;Looking back, what key moments or achievements in your journey with the company stand out to you the most?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Ten years is a long journey. Looking back on my years at Cosmic Development, I have seen how the company has been growing, spreading from one office in Skopje to opening offices in Bitola, Canada, and Serbia. This was challenging and required a lot of commitment from my department.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The number of employees has drastically increased. Also, my team has grown, and with it, my responsibilities. It was quite an experience that I have been involved in the whole process of evolving the company, and I am still eager for new achievements, which I am sure will follow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am happy and proud that I have been part of this successful story that continues.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>As a working mother and a key Finance team member, how have you balanced your professional responsibilities with your personal life over the past decade? Can you share some insights or tips for other working mothers striving to find that balance?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">&nbsp;I must start with the fact that it has been challenging and still is. My job is quite responsible and requires a full commitment. At the same time, the kids are at that age where they need our presence and help to guide them on the right path.&nbsp;To achieve a good work-life balance, I couldn't have succeeded without Cosmic, my coworkers, and my husband. Cosmic offers us full flexibility; we can arrange our time and work from home whenever needed. My coworkers and my supervisors are always supportive and understanding. My husband has my back at home. So, the tip here is to choose wisely.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What led you to pursue a career in social media advertising, and how did you end up at Cosmic Development?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Social media advertising offers work in various industries, making it a quite appealing profession. It is continuously progressing and challenging, which is why I chose this career path. For my part, Facebook marketing started by learning the basics of launching campaigns and driving traffic for my personal affiliate website. Later, I began to feel a particular affinity for it, which became my daily routine. Interestingly enough, seeing the ad results from the previous day was the first thing I was doing in the morning. Also, that encouraged me to work on my improvement and optimize my performance, therefore getting a better ROI while testing various tactics on the campaign. As soon as I gained valuable experience, my next goal was to upgrade my skills, so I enrolled in a digital marketing academy. A few months later, I noticed the Cosmic Development ad for FB Ads Manager, and I knew it was an opportunity I must not miss. Applying for the position and joining this company was one of the best decisions I have made in my life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Can you share what it's like working at Cosmic Development and your role as a Facebook Ads Manager?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have had the privilege of being part of the Cosmic Development team starting from February 2020 as a Facebook Ads Manager, and it has been a fantastic journey. Working here has allowed me to contribute to the growth and success of our clients through strategic and impactful Facebook advertising campaigns. As a Facebook Ads Manager, my role involves executing targeted campaigns that drive engagement and deliver tangible results for our clients. My experience at Cosmic Development as a Facebook Ads Manager has been enriching and fulfilling. I'm proud to be part of a company that values innovation, collaboration, and client success.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>How have the collaboration and team dynamics evolved, especially with the ongoing growth of your team?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My journey at Cosmic Development began as individual work. To be more precise, it was just me and a client's established vision. From the first moment, we worked in unison, determined to turn ideas into reality. Subsequently, our collaboration has evolved into a dynamic team of four, each contributing to it with their unique magic to our story. Our team structure is like a perfectly orchestrated symphony, where everyone plays a crucial role in advancing the established goals of our client's company. We have adopted tools like Slack that act as our virtual meeting place, ensuring we and the client are on the same page as we navigate the shared journey of growing an established company. Metaphorically speaking, leading this team is not about being a solo star but leading a band. I am more than glad that we have built a culture that values our individual concepts and our client's company's established legacy and dreams.</p>

<h3><strong>In what ways has Cosmic Development supported your professional growth and development as a Facebook Ads Manager?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working with Cosmic Development has significantly enhanced my skills as a Facebook Ads Manager. The company encourages continuous learning, providing access to courses, conferences, and workshops. These valuable benefits have allowed me to stay updated with the latest trends in digital marketing. Another important thing is that professional mentors gave me the exclusive opportunity to learn about leadership initiatives. I would not have achieved such leadership success without the assistance of experienced mentors abroad and their genuinely inspiring knowledge. Therefore, I can freely say that I owe my powerful leadership skills to all their mentorship programs and exposure to leadership activities. This experience has given me valuable insights into effective digital marketing leadership and enabled me to take on leadership responsibilities within my team.</p>

<h3><strong>What advice do you have for someone aspiring to become a Facebook Ads Manager or enter the field of digital marketing?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">YouTube is a goldmine for educational content. Many digital marketing specialists share insights, tutorials, and case studies, providing dynamic and up-to-date changes in Facebook advertising and digital marketing strategies. You can also join digital marketing forums and learn more about the forum members and their case studies. Remember to take all Meta Blueprint courses and look at Udemy and Skillshare, which guarantee high-quality content and an excellent starting point.</p>

<h3><strong>How do you see the future of Facebook advertising evolving, and what trends do you anticipate in the coming years?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Facebook keeps changing things up on its ad platform, from tweaking bits in the Ads Manager to big moves like taking away certain targeting choices. Also, it is continuously adding new ways to place ads and new simplified campaign objectives, which, by default, the starting date is scheduled in early 2024. One area that is likely to see significant growth in the coming years is augmented reality (AR) advertising. Meta already partnered with Ray-Ban and created the Meta smart glasses, so I expect more user content, like live streams and videos.&nbsp;</p>
